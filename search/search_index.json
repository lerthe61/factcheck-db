We are in a battle of wills, and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid of our own power.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, our unity and our support for Ukraine have been unprecedented. This has been driven by the strong conviction that military force shouldn\u2019t be used to invade neighboring countries in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and that all countries \u2014 big and small \u2014 should be free to choose their own future.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s resistance has been greatly empowered by both European and American support. Together, the transatlantic community has given the country military, humanitarian and economic assistance, while imposing some of the toughest sanctions ever against Russia.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s strategy, meanwhile, is built on the hope that we will tire first. The Kremlin remains confident it has more resolve than we do, still believing it can outlast, outproduce and outperform Ukraine, the Euro-Atlantic community and other global allies and partners.</p> <p>It is now time to prove this isn\u2019t the winning strategy.</p> <p>According to Eurobarometer, 87 percent of Estonians either totally agree or tend to agree that the EU should continue to show solidarity with Ukraine. For Finland, the figure is 88 percent. This speaks to the unwavering determination of both Estonians and Finns to support Ukraine.</p> <p>Since February 2022, Estonia\u2019s total assistance to the country has amounted to over \u20ac400 million \u2014 or more than 1 percent of its GDP. Finland\u2019s total bilateral assistance to Ukraine has amounted to \u20ac2.2 billion and includes 20 packages of defense materiel, as well as development cooperation, humanitarian aid and civilian materiel assistance. Moreover, Finland is one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest EU donors of energy sector equipment, such as generators and transformers.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Those who have fought and paid for peace with lives understand the true cost of freedom. Estonia and Finland don\u2019t take hard-won freedom for granted. We know from our histories that it has to be fought for \u2014 no matter the cost.</p> <p>What\u2019s at stake in Ukraine today is the very idea of freedom. It remains something that Russia and other autocracies fear and want to destroy.</p> <p>Russia wants to erase Ukraine as a sovereign state and redraw the borders of Europe by military force. This vision of \u201csecurity\u201d must not be allowed to prevail.</p> <p></p> <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shakes hand with Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas | Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images</p> <p>Peace on Russia\u2019s terms wouldn\u2019t mean peace in Europe. It would boost Russian nationalism and imperialism, and authoritarian regimes globally would learn that the free world is weak and has no stamina, leading to more conflict. Hence, supporting Ukraine isn\u2019t just about supporting Ukraine. Fundamentally, it is about defending the core principles of the U.N. Charter and international law, including territorial integrity and sovereignty \u2014 that is, the right to exist as a country.</p> <p>This understanding is widely shared, and it has been demonstrated by the majority of countries voting for U.N. General Assembly Resolutions \u2014 demanding the Russian Federation withdraw all military forces from Ukraine\u2019s territory, and affirming the international community\u2019s commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p> <p>Here, the message is clear: Supporting Ukraine isn\u2019t only about our European values and security, it\u2019s also a matter of universal values and global security. The price we pay to support Ukraine in its efforts to defeat Russian imperialism is little compared to what would follow if aggression were to pay off now.</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>Advertisement</p> <p>That\u2019s why our strategy demands clear commitment to reinforce long-term support for Ukraine. Our number one focus is arms, ammunition and training, all of which must be sustained at a magnitude sufficient for Ukraine\u2019s capacity to defend itself.</p> <p>We know what is required. Together, it is affordable and viable.</p> <p>As we convene at the European Council this week, a resolute demonstration of unfaltering long-term support for Ukraine is paramount. The eyes of the world are upon us, and at this critical juncture, our actions must mirror our words. The moment demands that our steadfast commitment align with our pledge of \u201cas long as it takes.\u201d</p> <p>Europe\u2019s response will send signals across the Atlantic, to our friends in Ukraine, as well as to Russia \u2014 a signal that we are prepared for the prolonged phase of the war, and that it isn\u2019t us who will get tired first.</p> <p>It is thus imperative the Council affirms ongoing strong budgetary and military support and decides to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, thereby underscoring our resolute commitment to its European future.</p> <p>Collaborating with the G7 and Ukraine, the EU is also actively engaged in forging lasting security commitments for the country.

Nikki Haley claimed the U.S. has spent 3.5% of its defense budget and gross domestic product (GDP) toward Ukraine.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s military recently said it had retaken control of Klishchiivka, a settlement near Bakhmut, according to The New York Times. Klishchiivka had previously been occupied by Russian forces, the outlet reported.</p> <p>Haley claimed 3.5% of the U.S. defense budget and GDP has been spent on Ukraine. Her comments followed a question from Tapper about House Republicans seeking to strip $24 billion in aid to Ukraine from the upcoming government spending bill.</p> <p>\u201cI think that you have to look at the fact that 3.5 percent has been spent from our defense budget towards Ukraine. That\u2019s just 3.5 percent, that percentage of [gross domestic product or] GDP. Eleven European countries have spent more than us,\u201d Haley said.</p> <p>Haley referred to both GDP and the defense budget in her answer. According to a fact sheet on U.S. Security Assistance published by the Department of Defense (DOD) on Sept. 7, 2023, the U.S. has committed more than $44.4 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since President Joe Biden took office. This includes more than $43.7 billion since the beginning of the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The fact sheet also provides a breakdown of U.S. support to Ukraine in terms of air defense, small arms, and aircraft, among others.</p> <p>Likewise, on Aug. 10, Biden asked Congress to approve $24 billion in aid to Ukraine, according to Reuters. The request was noted in an analysis piece published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who said it raised the total aid to $135 billion. (RELATED: Posts Claim Ukrainian Challenger 2 Tank Was Not Destroyed)</p> <p>Prior to Biden\u2019s request for more aid to Ukraine, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy\u2019s Ukraine Support Tracker indicated the U.S. had provided $69.484 billion in total commitments to the country. In comparison, European countries, including Sweden, France, the UK, and Poland, gave $2.356 billion, $1.693 billion, $13.767 billion, and $4.268 billion in total commitments to Ukraine, respectively.</p> <p>The commitments are measured in percentage of GDP, with data captured from Jan. 24, 2022 to Jul. 31, 2023, according to the website.</p> <p>Dr. Michael Desch, an American defense policy expert from the University of Notre Dame, questioned Haley\u2019s claim in an email to Check Your Fact, saying that \u201cGov. Haley is not very clear in her quote. She refers to U.S. aid to Ukraine as both a percentage of our Defense budget and of our GDP.\u201d</p> <p>Desch pointed to The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which lists bilateral aid from the U.S. to Ukraine between January 2022 and May 2023 as $76.8 billion, with $46.6 billion or 61% in military aid alone. The CFR cites the data from the Ukraine Support Tracker in a graphic identifying the various forms of aid the country has received. Biden\u2019s fiscal year 2022 defense budget was $752.9 billion for national defense, while the U.S. GDP for 2022 was $25,462.70 billion.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that our 2022 defense budget was $753 billion and our GDP was $25,463 billion, that would make the percentages 10% and .3%,\u201d Desch said.</p> <p>Desch also said that comparing aid in terms of GDP \u00a0is \u201cnot a particularly meaningful comparison, in my opinion.\u201d Desch said, \u201cFor example, the country with the highest percentage of GDP spent on aid to Ukraine is Latvia, with 1%.\u00a0 But given that Latvia\u2019s GDP in 2022 was $41.15 billion, that means that the total value of their aid was roughly $412 million, or .5 percent of what the U.S sent.\u201d</p> <p>July 2023 data from the Kiel Institute cited in a Sept. 21 BBC article reiterates that while the U.S. has spent more in aid to Ukraine than other countries, it is still less than the aid provided by the European Union (EU). A spokesperson for the Kiel Institute told Check Your Fact in an email that \u201ctotal committed aid to Ukraine (not just military\u2019) from the U.S. is about 0.3% of 2021 GDP.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt might be tricky to compare on a year by year basis, given that the appropriation procedures for allocating aid follow the U.S fiscal year for the budget and yearly GDP may be calculated in different ways, but any way one would want to count it, it would be very difficult to reach this 3.5% of GDP,\u201d the spokesperson added.</p> <p>Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 International Security Program, told Check Your Fact in an email that \u201c[a]nswering the question is complicated because there are many ways to interpret the statement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst there is a question about how one defines \u2018aid to Ukraine.\u2019 Only about half of the money appropriated for \u2018Ukraine\u2019 actually goes to Ukraine. The other half goes to elements of the US government, particularly DoD, and various humanitarian organizations outside of Ukraine,\u201d Cancian said.</p> <p>Cancian also said:</p> <p>\u201cMeasured by percentage of GDP, the United States at .3% is behind most European countries, with 30 others ahead of the United States. Measured as a percentage of the defense budget, military aid to Ukraine (excluding humanitarian assistance, economic support, and money going to other US agencies) comes to about 3.5% of the defense budget over the two fiscal years of the war. This may be the 3.5% that Haley referred to. I don\u2019t have comparisons to other countries. The number needs to be handle cautiously, however, because all the Ukraine aid was added to the budget and did not come out of DoD base budget.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBottom line: measured by dollars, the United States is far ahead of other countries. Measured by level of effort, percentage of GDP, many countries exceed the US effort,\u201d Cancian added.</p> <p>A spokesperson from the Haley campaign defended the former governor\u2019s claim in an email to Check Your Fact.</p> <p>\u201cSince the war began in Feb. 2022, the U.S. has spent roughly\u00a03.5%\u00a0of our\u00a0total\u00a0defense spending\u00a0on military aid to\u00a0Ukraine\u2014that\u2019s more than\u00a0\\(43B](https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/#:~:text=Since%202014%2C%20the%20United%20States,and%20improve%20interoperability%20with%20NATO.&amp;text=21%20air%20surveillance%20radars.) in military aid,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cU.S.\u00a0Defense\u00a0Dept. spending since Feb. 2022, when Russia invaded =\u00a0[\\)1.2T (roughly pro-rated for the months since the invasion).\u201d</p> <p>The campaign linked to a Sept. 21 statement from the State Department and a Department of Defense (DOD) document referring to the agency\u2019s requests for their fiscal year budget for 2024.

In addition, Check Your Fact has contacted other U.S. defense spending and Ukraine experts and will update this piece accordingly if one is received.</p> <p>Elias Atienza contributed to this report. </p> <p>Update 9/25/2023: After publication, a Haley spokesperson told Check Your Fact that we \u201cmisunderstood in the interview because these are two separate stats.

The other is that 11 European countries have given more in aid to Ukraine as a % of GDP.\u201d</p> <p>Around 30 European countries spend more of a percentage of their GDP on aid to Ukraine than the U.S., according to Cancian and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.</p> <p>share on facebook tweet this</p>"},{"location":"articles/fact-check-breaking-down-nikki-haleys-claim-about-ukraine-aid-spending/#christine-sellers","title":"Christine Sellers","text":""},{"location":"articles/fact-check-breaking-down-nikki-haleys-claim-about-ukraine-aid-spending/#fact-check-reporter","title":"Fact Check Reporter","text":""},{"location":"articles/fact-check-cnn-article-texas-school-shooting-victim/","title":"FACT CHECK: Did CNN Report That A Man Named \u2018Bernie Gores\u2019 Was Killed In The \u00a0Uvalde, Texas School \u00a0Shooting?","text":"<p>10:04 PM 05/26/2022 Elias Atienza | Senior Reporter</p> <p>share on facebook tweet this</p> <p>An image\u00a0shared on Facebook claims CNN reported that a man named \u201cBernie Gores\u201d was killed in the recent Uvalde, Texas school \u00a0shooting.</p> <p>Verdict: False</p> <p>A CNN spokesperson denied the outlet published such an article.

The original document shows that the United States allegedly estimated Ukraine has suffered around 15,500 to 17,000 deaths, not 71,000.</p> <p>Fact Check:</p> <p>The Pentagon and other U.S agencies are investigating how a trove of classified documents leaked, according to CNN. The classified documents allegedly show the extent of U.S spying and intelligence on allied partners and adversaries, the outlet reported.</p> <p>The Facebook post claims that Ukraine has suffered 71,000 deaths to Russia\u2019s 17,000 deaths. The claim was widely shared on social media, including Twitter, with one tweet receiving over 900,000 views.</p> <p>The claim, however, is based on an altered document.\u00a0Check Your Fact obtained an image of the original document that circulated showing Russian and Ukrainian losses. (While several screenshots of the images remain online, many of the documents have disappeared from social media platforms such as Twitter and Discord, according to BBC.) The original document shows between 35,500 and 43,000 Russian troops have been killed, while Ukraine has suffered between 16,000 and 17,500 dead.</p> <p>A different document, also obtained by Check Your Fact, is titled \u201cRussia/Ukraine: Assessed Combat Sustainability And Attrition.\u201d This document shows that the Defense Intelligence Agency estimated that Ukraine has suffered between 15,500 and 17,500 deaths, while Russia has suffered between 35,000 and 43,000 deaths. Ukraine has suffered between 109,000 and 113,000 wounded, while Russia has suffered between 154,000 and 180,000 wounded.</p> <p>\u201cWe have low confidence in Russian (RUS) and Ukrainian (UKR) attrition rates and inventories because of information gaps, OPSEC and IO efforts, and potential bias in UKR information sharing,\u201d the document reads. \u201cCasualty assessments, which fluctuate depending on the source, are informed by RUS, Vagner, and UKR officials.\u201d</p> <p>Check Your Fact has not been able to independently determine the authenticity of the documents.

The NYT later issued an update acknowledging that Ukrainian casualties are likely higher than reported. The U.N. has not verified the civilian death toll numbers from the Israeli bombing campaign against Gaza.</p> <p>Fact Check:</p> <p>The NYT sent a tweet Nov. 25 stating, \u201cIn less than two months, more than twice as many women and children have been reported killed in Gaza than in Ukraine after two years of war.\u201d The tweet includes a link to an article about Israel\u2019s bombing campaign in Gaza, which it launched after the Hamas terror group launched an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 240 people.</p> <p>The tweet, though, is misleading. First, an archived version of the article shows that the NYT relied on figures from the U.N. The NYT reported, \u201cMore than twice as many women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza than in Ukraine after almost two years of Russian attacks, according to United Nations estimates.\u201d</p> <p>However, this is missing important context and misleads on what the U.N. has reported. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported that it has verified 9,701 civilian deaths in Ukraine as of Sept. 24, 2023.</p> <p>The OHCHR explains how it verified civilian casualties, saying:  </p> <p>\u201cReports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information.\u201d</p> <p>The OHCHR believes that the death toll is higher than what it has verified. The OHCHR said in the Sept. 2023 update that it \u201cbelieves that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties,\u201d the OHCHR said.</p> <p>Furthermore, the figures from Gaza do not appear to be verified by the U.N. but are provided by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health. For example, a Nov. 6 United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) report said that \u201cthe Ministry of Health (MoH) in \u00a0Gaza, over 10,000 people, including 2,550 women, 4,104 children and 596 older people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October.\u201d Gaza officials said that the death toll is now over 15,000 as of Nov. 27, according to Andaolu Ajansi.</p> <p>The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a Nov. 18 update that \u201cthe UN has so far not been able to produce independent, comprehensive, and verified casualty figures; the current numbers have been provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza and the Israeli authorities and await further verification. Other yet-to-be verified figures are also sourced.\u201d</p> <p>The NYT story itself includes a graph that says the source of the civilian casualties was \u201cGaza officials.\u201d (RELATED: Claims Of Mass IDF Casualties Lack Evidence)</p> <p></p> <p>Screenshot/New York Times</p> <p>An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson disputed the death toll reported by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health in an email to Check Your Fact.</p> <p>\u201cThe IDF condemns the actions of the Hamas terror organization as they use civilian infrastructure as a human shield, which leads to the unfortunate death of innocent civilians. The Palestinian Ministry of Health is a bureau working directly under the influence of the Hamas terror organization, the information being released by them is twisted, fake, and not confirmed,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>The numbers reported from the Hamas-controlled health ministry are generally considered reliable, according to The Washington Post. The Times of Israel reported the figures from the health ministry \u201ccannot be independently verified and do not distinguish between civilians and terrorists, and also do not differentiate between those killed by Israeli airstrikes and those killed in failed Palestinian rocket launches.\u201d</p> <p>PBS also reported that, citing U.N. officials and Palestinian officials in the West Bank, the agency has \u201clong made a good-faith effort to account for the dead under the most difficult conditions,\u201d while providing how the count is determined.</p> <p>The health ministry\u2019s figures also likely include 471 deaths from the Oct. 17 Gaza\u2019s Al-Ahli Hospital hospital explosion. A U.S. intelligence assessment says that the death toll is likely between 100-300 people, while the director of the Shifa Hospital said the death toll was around 250, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>Several independent analyses, including from The Associated Press and Human Rights Watch, found that the likely cause of the explosion was a rocket \u2013commonly used by Palestinian armed groups\u2013 though a definitive cause has not been determined. The IDF said the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group was responsible for the explosion, while Hamas said Israel caused it, according to France 24.</p> <p>Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said in a Nov. 8 hearing that the death toll in Gaza could be higher than what the health ministry said it was, according to The Hill.</p> <p>\u201cIn this period of conflict and conditions of war, it is very difficult for any of us to assess what the rate of casualties are. We think they\u2019re very high, frankly, and it could be that they\u2019re even higher than are being cited,\u201d Leaf said.</p> <p>A NYT spokesperson told Check Your Fact in an email \u201cthe source of deaths reported in Gaza\u201d was from \u201cGazan officials.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs the report and graphs make clear, the source for deaths reported in \u00a0Gaza during the current 2023 conflict is Gazan officials. The U.N. source refers to Ukrainians confirmed killed in Ukraine, which has been updated to note that the true toll of war in Ukraine is likely to be considerably higher than the official figures report,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>Victoria Coates, former deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration and the vice president of national security and foreign policy at the Heritage Foundation, criticized the New York Times tweet.</p> <p>\u201cOnce again, The New York Times is has exposed their eagerness to exploit any reported data that supports their ideological agenda regardless of how dodgy it might be,\u201d Coates told Check Your Fact in an email. \u201cIn this tweet they are relying on Hamas for their figures on Gaza, and Hamas habitually inflates these numbers to garner global support and demonize Israel\u2014for example in the case of the Oct. 17 explosion at Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza,\u00a0The New York Times itself reported that the original figure the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Authority publicized (471) was probably closer to 100.\u201d</p> <p>Coates pointed to the OHCHR\u2019s September report on Ukraine\u2019s civilian deaths, noting that the report says deaths are higher than what the agency has verified.</p> <p>\u201cSo according to their own recent experience, the Hamas figures could be inflated by five times while according to the UN the Ukrainian numbers could be much greater.\u00a0 Rather than peddling sensationalist click bait, the Times might want to get their facts straight before they tweet,\u201d Coates said.</p> <p>Ukrainian officials also have far higher estimates for civilian casualties than what the UN has verified. Ukrainian officials estimated that at least 25,000 civilians died during the Siege of Mariupol, which lasted from February 2022 to May 2022, according to BBC News. Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor told the Independent in February 2023 that there \u201ccould be 100,000 civilians killed across Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p>A December 2022 Associated Press analysis found \u201cthe death toll\u201d in Mariupol \u201cmight run three times higher than an early estimate of at least 25,000.\u201d Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in June 2022 that \u201cOHCHR has verified 1,348 individual civilian deaths directly in hostilities in Mariupol, including 70 children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe actual death toll of hostilities on civilians is likely thousands higher,\u201d Bachelet said at the time.</p> <p>U.S. officials told Fox News in May 2023 that 42,000 Ukrainian civilians had died since Russia invaded in February 2022.</p> <p>The NYT later updated its sub-headline from \u201c[i]n less than two months, more than twice as many women and children have been reported killed in Gaza than in Ukraine after two years of war\u201d to \u201c[e]ven a conservative assessment of the reported Gaza casualty figures shows that the rate of death during Israel\u2019s assault has few precedents in this century, experts say.\u201d</p> <p>The outlet also added that the \u201cUnited Nations believes the true toll in Ukraine is considerably higher, however, and Ukrainian officials have estimated that more than 20,000 civilians died in the port city of Mariupol.\u201d</p> <p>The NYT also changed a sentence from \u201cMore than twice as many women and children have already been reported killed in \u00a0Gaza than in Ukraine after almost two years of Russian attacks, according to United Nations estimates\u201d to \u201cMore than twice as many women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza than have been confirmed killed in Ukraine, according to United Nations figures, after almost two years of Russian attacks.\u201d\u00a0(Emphasis added by Check Your Fact).\u00a0</p> <p>The NYT did not issue an editor\u2019s note or update indicating that these changes were made, though the article says it was updated \u201cNov. 26.\u201d\u00a0 The original tweet also remains live as of publishing time and has a Community Notes attached to it.

This came with the Ukrainian military\u2019s improved long-range strike prowess enabling salvos onto Russian forward air-bases. Especially, in October 2023, the ATACMS strike in Berdyansk marked a new calculus in this sense. Tactical aviation is very base-reliant.

Ukraine accused Russia of hitting the market, while Russian officials did not claim responsibility for the attack, the outlet reported.</p> <p>Multiple media outlets, such as The New York Times, NBC News and CNN, reported that it was a Russian missile that hit the market, citing Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy.</p> <p>However, there is evidence that a Ukrainian missile hit the market, not a Russian missile. The New York Times published an article 12 days following their initial report stating that the evidence pointed to a Ukrainian anti-air missile. The outlet reported that \u201cevidence collected and analyzed by The New York Times, including missile fragments, satellite imagery, witness accounts and social media posts, strongly suggests the catastrophic strike was the result of an errant Ukrainian air defense missile fired by a Buk launch system.\u201d</p> <p>Ukraine does use the Buk system, which is described as a \u201ca four-person tracked vehicle with a built-in radar and a launcher for four two-ton missiles,\u201d according to Forbes. The New York Times reported that holes left behind by the missile\u2019s impact were consistent with a 9M38 Buk missile. The outlet also spoke with a witness who said they saw an air defense missile go from the Ukrainian-held town of Druzhkivka in the direction of Kostiantynivka. (RELATED: Posts Claims Ukrainian Challenger 2 Tank Was Not Destroyed)</p> <p>New York Times reporters stationed in Druzhkivka heard the launch of air defense missiles from the town before the market was struck. Times reporters also went to a suspected launch site for the missiles and found scorch marks and other markers that the Ukrainian military had been there such as \u201ctrenches, trash pits and wide tracks consistent with a large military vehicle.\u201d</p> <p>Russia has constantly hit and targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure such as schools and residences, the New York Times reported. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights found in August 2023 that 9,511 civilians, including over 500 children, had been killed and 17,206 were wounded since Russia invaded in February 2022.</p> <p>Ruslan Leviev, project director at the investigative group Conflict Intelligence Team, told Check Your Fact that they \u201ccame to almost the same conclusion a long time before NYT.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnlike the New York Times, we had no missile fragments or witnesses who saw air defense missiles being launched. That\u2019s why we thought that this was AGM-88 HARM missile. But general conclusion was the same right from the beginning: it was [a][U]krainian missile, coming from the north-west, mishap, tragic accident,\u201d Leviev said and linked to the CIT\u2019s dispatches from Sept. 7 and Sept. 20.</p> <p>Jett Goldsmith, managing editor of the open source investigative organization Offbeat Research, told Check Your Fact that the New York Times article was \u201cforensically valid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom available open-source evidence, the New York Times investigation is forensically valid and consistent with prior reports of malfunctioning surface-to-air missile (SAM) launches on both sides of the conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Goldsmith said. \u201cRussian and Ukrainian forces are often reliant on outdated and previously poorly maintained Soviet-era weapons systems, including surface-to-air Buk and S300 systems which have a history of targeting failures resulting in ground casualties such as this.\u201d</p> <p>Goldsmith added,\u201dSome open-source metrics which were tapped by the New York Times, including satellite image analysis, are often reliant on partial or otherwise impacted datasets and thus may be unreliable alone. But the preponderance of evidentiary analysis used by the New York Times, including basic directional analysis and audio analysis pegged chronologically to the timeline of the strike, supports their claim that a missile launched from territory controlled by Ukraine hit the area in question.\u201d</p> <p>Ukrainian authorities rejected the New York Times report. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s presidential office, said in a tweet that the \u201clegal truth will be established\u201d in response to the New York Times article.</p> <p>\u201cAmong other things, the circumstances of the strike on Kostiantynivka are also being studied. In any case, the legal truth will be established. In the meantime, we must not forget: it was Russia that launched the invasion of Ukraine and it is Russia that is responsible for bringing war to our country,\u201d Podolyak tweeted.</p> <p>The Security Services of Ukraine (SBU) told Reuters that while an investigation is still ongoing, said investigation pointed to a Russian S-300 missile as responsible for the market tragedy. (RELATED: Russia Today Headline Claiming Prigozhin\u2019s Pilot Had Post-Vaccine Myocarditis Is Fabricated)</p> <p>\u201cThis is evidenced, in particular, by the identified missile fragments recovered at the scene of the tragedy,\u201d the SBU said, according to Reuters. A unnamed source told Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian outlet, that the Ukrainian Air Force did not use Buk anti-air systems that day. Other sources told the outlet that the Ukrainian Ground Forces does not possess Buk systems.</p> <p>The New York Times updated two articles that reported a Russian missile strike hit the market with corrections. A Facebook post, though, still claims that a Russian missile hit the market.</p> <p>\u201cAn earlier version of this article overstated what is known about the origin of the missile that struck the street market in Kostyantynivka. While President Volodymyr Zelensky attributed the strike to Russia, which had shelled the town in recent months, evidence uncovered later suggests an errant Ukrainian missile may have hit the market. A spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said the country\u2019s security service was investigating the episode,\u201d the correction reads.</p> <p>Check Your Fact reached out to the SBU, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, CNN, The New York Times and NBC News for comment.</p> <p>Update 9/26/2023: This article has been updated to reflect that the New York Times corrected two articles about the missile strike. </p> <p>share on facebook tweet this</p>"},{"location":"articles/fact-check-sept-6-missile-ukrainian-market/#elias-atienza","title":"Elias Atienza","text":""},{"location":"articles/fact-check-sept-6-missile-ukrainian-market/#senior-reporter","title":"Senior Reporter","text":"<p>Follow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

No, that's not true: The video mixes video of different briefings, during which Miller made no such remarks. The words falsely attributed to him in the video were AI-generated. The State Department labeled the video a deepfake.</p> <p>The story appeared in a post (archived here) on X, formerly known as Twitter, where it was published by @Sprinterfactory on May 31, 2024. It opened:</p> <p>Washington, DC.</p> <p>The US State Department, represented by Matthew Miller, stated that there are no civilians in Belgorod, so everyone who is there is a legitimate military target.</p> <p>Question: '[...] What do you think about other countries, 10 of which have allowed their weapons to be used to hit targets on Russian territory. Will they hit military targets?'</p> <p>MM: 'We see how the situation is developing. We need to draw a clear line between what is a civilian object and what is not.</p> <p>We know that there are virtually no civilians left in Belgorod, a Russian city located about 45 miles [72 km] from the Ukrainian city of Kharkov.</p> <p>At the moment, it is almost full of military facilities and we are seeing the same thing begin in neighboring regions.[...]</p> <p>So we're going to support our allies in whatever they decide to do, and maybe help some people who are on the fence make the right decision.'</p> <p>This is what it looked like at the time of writing:</p> <p></p> <p>(Source: X screenshot taken on Mon Jun 3 13:58:40\u202f 2024 UTC)</p> <p>In the video, Miller, the U.S. State Department spokesperson, appeared to be saying the following in this exchange:</p> <p>REPORTER: You've already made the US position on this issue, but you haven't addressed what you think about other countries already 10 of them, allowing their weapons to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Will they have the capability to strike military targets?</p> <p>MILLER: We're all witnessing the situation unfolding. We need to draw a clear line between what is a civilian object and what is not. We're aware that Belgorod a Russian city roughly 45 miles from Ukrainian Kharkov has essentially no civilians remaining. It's practically full of military targets at this point. And we are seeing the same thing starting in the regions around there. Russia needs to get the message that this is unacceptable. So we're going to back our allies in whatever they decide to do, and maybe help some of the folks who are on the fence about this make the right choice.</p> <p>The setting in the video on X was consistent with what the State Department briefing room looks like, and the caption implied that it was a recent announcement.</p> <p>But the video is concocted of several different events and fake audio was added that put the words about Belgorod in Miller's mouth.</p> <p>The last time U.S. State Department Speaker Matthew Miller was seen wearing the same white shirt and blue tie paired with the dark blue jacket during the agency's briefing was on May 9, 2024. A Lead Stories reporter listened to that press conference in its entirety: Miller did not mention Belgorod.</p> <p>At the 30:18 mark in the official recording, the same person in the same clothes as in the video on X starts to ask questions, but, contrary to the claim, the exchange had nothing to do with Russia -- it was about the Israeli military operation in Gaza:</p> <p>QUESTION: I just wanted to clarify something you said at the top. I think I heard you say there are certain types of military systems that we will not make available to Israel for use in a Rafah campaign. Does the president's statement preclude delivering those weapons shipments or analogous ones to Israel for use in other areas during this timeframe?</p> <p>MILLER: I am just not going to get beyond what the president said last night at this point. We've made clear what our policy is, we will engage with the government of Israel about this question and others. But as I said at the top, while we are opposed to, let's speak about this generally, while we're opposed to a major Rafah military operation, we do still support Israel's right to defend itself against other threats -- that has not changed, that will not change. The president's commitment to Israel's security is ironclad. And I should have said this earlier. So I'll make the point now. We actually think, we actually do believe that a Rafa campaign, actually, in addition to all the harm it would cause the Palestinian people, actually weekens Israel security, doesn't make it stronger. It's one of the other reasons were opposed to the campaign.</p> <p>REPORTER: So and it's just a practical matter, do you assess that Israel requires the weapons in these shipments to proceed with the camp(aign)?</p> <p>MILLER: I just am not going to get into the details of how they would conduct an operation at all.</p> <p>REPORTER: Okay, so well, then (inaudible) granted your point that they're not concerned in these negotiations about civilian casualties, you have said before you eluded just now there is Hamas, there are military targets in Rafah. Does Hamas in these negotiations feel an incentive to release hostages in order to preserve that military infrastructure?</p> <p>MILLER: We think the only thing that Hamas leadership cares about is protecting themselves. I'm kind of limited in what I can say here. But ultimately, when you look at the things that are on the table in a hostage deal, to the point of a hostage deal, the things that Hamas gets out of it are things that would benefit the civilian population of Gaza...</p> <p>An advanced Google search utilizing the keywords seen here (archived here) showed that Miller mentioned Belgorod twice during the State Department's briefings, but he did not say the words the video on X claimed he did.</p> <p>On February 14, 2024, the exchange was brief:</p> <p></p> <p>(Source: Department of State screenshot taken on Mon Jun 3 17:14:56\u202f 2024 UTC)</p> <p>On May 22, 2023, a year before the publication of the viral clip on X, Miller did discuss the matter of Ukrainian attacks on Russian territories but his response was different from what the clip on X purported to show: At the time, the State Department's representative said that the U.S. does not encourage such strikes, though it allows Kyiv a choice on how to conduct its military operations.</p> <p></p> <p>(Source: State Department screenshot taken on Mon Jun 3 17:32:39\u202f2024 UTC)</p> <p>Lead Stories searched for a precise quote (archived here) from the purported speech but found no matches on government websites.</p> <p>What was remarkable about the video on X was that Miller was seen in different clothes that he seemed to have changed in a matter of seconds while being on the podium: At the 18-second mark, he appeared wearing a different tie and shirt than at the beginning of the clip.

For example, during the third Republican primary debate on Oct. 28, 2015, Trump said, \u201cHere, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000.\u201d Christie was on the stage at the time. But that\u2019s just one of numerous examples of Trump talking during the 2016 campaign about needing just 1,000 miles of border wall.</p> <p>After Trump was elected, he began to move the goal posts \u2014 from 1,000 miles to 900 to 800 to 700 and even less.

But most of it, 373 miles worth, was replacement barriers for primary or secondary fencing that was dilapidated or outdated. About 52 miles of new primary wall and 33 miles of secondary wall were built where no barriers had been before.</p> <p>So Trump never built the length of wall he promised during the campaign, and Mexico never paid for any of the wall that was built. During his presidency, Trump tried to claim that Mexico was paying for the wall through the newly negotiated U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was not accurate. Trump later claimed he never meant that Mexico would \u201cwrite out a check\u201d to pay for the wall.

It\u2019s his [Trump\u2019s],\u201d Christie said. \u201cIt\u2019s his fault, because he never changed one immigration law. In the two years that he had Republicans control the Congress, not one immigration law did he change. He didn\u2019t build the wall like he told us to. And Mexico is laughing at us, at the idea that they were going to pay for a wall on their border.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true that Congress didn\u2019t pass \u2014 and Trump didn\u2019t sign \u2014 any major immigration bills. In fact, the last major immigration bill that made it into law happened in 1986. But Christie\u2019s comment ignores the numerous changes Trump instituted simply through executive actions.</p> <p>According to a February 2022 Migration Policy Institute report: \u201cOver the course of four years, the Trump administration set an unprecedented pace for executive action on immigration, enacting 472 administrative changes that dismantled and reconstructed many elements of the U.S. immigration system. Humanitarian protections were severely diminished. The U.S.-Mexico border became more closed off. Immigration enforcement appeared more random. And legal immigration became out of reach for many. All of this was accomplished nearly exclusively by the executive branch, with sweeping presidential proclamations and executive orders, departmental policy guidance, and hundreds of small, technical adjustments. Congress, which has been deadlocked on immigration legislation for years, largely sidelined itself during this period of incredibly dynamic policy change.\u201d</p> <p>As the report details, Trump increased enforcement along the border, limited asylum eligibility, significantly reduced the admission of refugees and pressured Mexico to increase its own immigration enforcement. In one example, Trump instituted changes to the Migrant Protection Protocols, better known as the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, so that asylum seekers were sent to Mexico to await their court appearances in the U.S.</p> <p>The COVID-19 outbreak afforded Trump further opportunity to check illegal immigration, as his administration started using\u00a0Title 42, a public health law\u00a0that allowed border officials to immediately return Mexican migrants caught trying to enter the country illegally. With the pandemic officially over, the Biden administration finally lifted Title 42 in early May.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump administration was arguably the first to take full advantage of the executive branch\u2019s vast authority on immigration,\u201d the MPI report states. \u201cDespite the relative fragility of executive actions when compared to legislation, the pace and comprehensiveness of the moves taken by Trump and his administration likely ensure that some will have lasting effects on the U.S. immigration system long after his time in office. At the very least, the Trump administration set a precedent for conducting far-reaching immigration changes through executive activism.\u201d</p> <p>Whether those policies worked is a matter of debate. As we noted in our story, \u201cTrump\u2019s Final Numbers,\u201d the number of apprehensions for illegal border crossings fluctuated wildly during Trump\u2019s presidency. After a steep decrease in his first year in office, apprehensions increased the following two years and were higher in Trump\u2019s final year than all but one of the years under President Barack Obama. However, the number of apprehensions exploded after Biden took office. As we noted in our latest installment of \u201cBiden\u2019s Numbers,\u201d apprehensions rose 342% when comparing the 12 months ending in March to Trump\u2019s last year in office.</p>"},{"location":"articles/factchecking-chris-christies-presidential-announcement/#pfizers-covid-19-vaccine","title":"Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine","text":"<p>In rejecting price controls on pharmaceutical drugs, Christie left the misleading impression that Pfizer alone had developed a COVID-19 vaccine and U.S. residents were the first to get access to it because Pfizer benefited from the U.S. free-market system.</p> <p>In fact, Pfizer partnered with BioNTech, a German-based company, on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which became available at the same time in several countries, including the U.S., Canada and the European Union\u2019s 27 member countries.</p> <p>Christie, June 6: When COVID happened, the American people got the treatments first and the vaccines first, because we lived here. Because we have a pharmaceutical industry in this country and that we support in this country that is changing the face of medical treatment here and throughout the world. But we get it first. And we get it first because places like Pfizer invested billions of dollars of their own money, not government money, they didn\u2019t take any government money, billions of dollars of their own money on a technology that they didn\u2019t even exactly know how they were going to use it. And then when COVID came, the mRNA technology they were using turned out to be able to help significantly in getting rid of the pandemic we had in this country.</p> <p>So I\u2019m very concerned about us going to a system like Canada or Great Britain, where we control prices, fix prices, and we fix profits, because then there\u2019s no reason to take risk.</p> <p>While it\u2019s true that Pfizer didn\u2019t receive any U.S. government funding for COVID-19 vaccine trials or research and development, its partner did receive government funding from Germany. BioNTech received $445 million from the German government in September 2020 to accelerate development of its COVID-19 vaccine candidates.</p> <p>Christie didn\u2019t mention BioNTech, but it was the German company that developed the novel messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine against COVID-19. \u201cWe believe that by pairing Pfizer\u2019s development, regulatory and commercial capabilities with BioNTech\u2019s mRNA vaccine technology and expertise as one of the industry leaders, we are reinforcing our commitment to do everything we can to combat this escalating pandemic, as quickly as possible,\u201d a top Pfizer executive said in a March 2020 statement announcing the collaboration.</p> <p>Also, Pfizer and BioNTech benefited from years of U.S. government-funded research into the platform used by the companies to successfully develop a COVID-19 vaccine. (Moderna also benefited from the U.S.-funded research for its mRNA vaccine.)</p> <p>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which is within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \u201chas for years invested in the messenger RNA (or mRNA) platform for vaccine development, the technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d the journal Health Affairs wrote in May 2021. \u201cSince 2006, Congress has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars that BARDA used to develop the scientific infrastructure to produce vaccines in response to the threat of pandemic flu. Thus, the basic research undergirding the COVID-19 vaccines was largely publicly supported.\u201d</p> <p>Lastly, Christie\u2019s suggestion that Pfizer made the vaccine available to U.S. residents first is incorrect.</p> <p>On July 22, 2020, Pfizer/BioNTech signed an agreement with the U.S. to deliver up to 600 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. A press release said, \u201cThe U.S. government will pay the companies $1.95 billion upon the receipt of the first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization or approval. The U.S. government also can acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.\u201d</p> <p>Pfizer/BioNTech soon signed agreements with Canada and the EU. The distribution of the vaccines depended on government authorization of the vaccine. Canada authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Dec. 7, 2020, followed by the U.S. (Dec. 11, 2020) and the EU (Dec. 21, 2020).</p> <p>It was this guarantee of a large market for COVID-19 vaccines that made the development of a vaccine financially attractive and less risky.</p> <p>Canada and the U.S. started to administer Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines on the same day in Dec. 14, 2020, and the EU began its vaccination program later that month.</p>"},{"location":"articles/factchecking-chris-christies-presidential-announcement/#obamas-aid-to-ukraine","title":"Obama\u2019s Aid to Ukraine","text":"<p>While talking about \u201cforeign policy mistakes\u201d made by past U.S. presidents, Christie repeated the claim that Obama only provided Ukraine with \u201cblankets\u201d and \u201chuman rights aid\u201d after Russia invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and began seizing territory in eastern Ukraine in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how we get to the next mistake, which was, in my view, Barack Obama allowing the continued encroachment on Ukrainian territory by the Russians and doing nothing,\u201d Christie said. \u201cNothing but sending them blankets, and, you know, human rights aid.

But as we have explained before, that number is a bit inflated by repeat offenders.</p> <p>Many of the apprehensions at the border have been illegal border crossings that resulted in immediate expulsions under Title 42, a public health law the Trump administration\u00a0began invoking at the southwest border in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Instead of being detained for a longer period of time, being criminally prosecuted or having a formal removal order placed on their record, those subject to Title 42 were simply turned around at the border. As a result, experts at the Migration Policy Institute said, it encouraged people to try crossing again and again, driving up the apprehension numbers. CBP data back that up.

Finally, there is the pandemic, which chilled mobility of all sorts globally in 2020 and into 2021.

The pipeline is completed, but not operational because it needs Germany\u2019s approval \u2014 which the country withheld because of Russian aggression in Ukraine.</p> <p>We have been over this issue more than once, because Trump has falsely claimed that Biden \u201capproved\u201d Nord Stream 2 and \u201copened it up.\u201d</p> <p>A quick rundown of the facts: Nord Stream 2 runs parallel to Nord Stream 1, which has been operational since 2011. Both are owned by Gazprom, a state-owned gas company, as explained in a March 2022 report by the Congressional Research Service. The U.S. has been concerned about Europe\u2019s increasing reliance on Russian energy and tried to stop the pipeline \u201cthrough progressively more stringent sanctions legislation enacted in 2017, 2019, and 2020\u201d that slowed down construction.</p> <p>After the 2019 sanctions, which targeted companies involved in the construction of the pipeline, work was suspended for about a year, resuming in December 2020, while Trump and Pence were still in office. At the time, the pipeline was reportedly about 90% complete.</p> <p>After taking office, the Biden administration indicated that its \u201cability to prevent the pipeline from becoming operational was limited, even with additional sanctions,\u201d CRS said in its report. The Biden administration also \u201cexpressed concern that additional U.S. sanctions could have jeopardized U.S.-German and U.S.-European cooperation,\u201d because Germany saw \u201cthe pipeline as an important natural gas corridor,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>In May 2021, Biden\u00a0waived sanctions\u00a0against those involved in the Nord Stream 2 project, which was completed\u00a0in September 2021. Pence is presumably referring to the sanctions being waived, when he said Biden gave \u201cRussia back a Nord Stream 2 deal.\u201d But, as we said, the pipeline is still not operational and final approval is up to Germany.</p> <p>In response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, Germany on Feb. 22, 2022, suspended the certification process that Russia needs to operate the pipeline, and the U.S. a day later resumed sanctions against Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of Gazprom, and its executives. Since the war started, Nord Stream 2 AG has received two court extensions in an effort to stave off bankruptcy.

The FBI was on my front doorstep the next day,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd what we found out was that, when Joe Biden apparently alerted the Department of Justice, 80 days later, they showed up at his office. That\u2019s not equal treatment under the law.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not an accurate account of how things unfolded regarding classified documents held by Biden.</p> <p>But let\u2019s start with Pence\u2019s mishandling of classified documents. After the classified documents investigations emerged for both Biden and Trump, Pence said he \u201ctook it upon myself to review our files\u201d at his home in Indiana.</p> <p>According to\u00a0NBC News, a team of lawyers for Pence discovered a \u201csmall number of documents that could potentially contain sensitive or classified information\u201d in Pence\u2019s residence on Jan. 16, and they immediately notified the National Archives. The National Archives alerted the Department of Justice, and three days later, on Jan. 19 \u2014 with Pence\u2019s blessing \u2014 FBI agents came to Pence\u2019s Indiana home and retrieved the documents, NBC reported.</p> <p>Three weeks later, on Feb. 10, the FBI \u2014 with the cooperation of Pence \u2014 conducted a five-hour search of Pence\u2019s home and discovered another classified document,\u00a0NBC News reported.</p> <p>Last week, Pence\u00a0was informed\u00a0that he would not be charged for his mishandling of classified documents, according to a letter obtained by NBC News.</p> <p>\u201cThey concluded that it was an innocent mistake,\u201d\u00a0Pence said\u00a0at the CNN town hall.</p> <p>That\u2019s not dissimilar from the way things were handled in the case involving Biden. The Justice Department quickly retrieved classified documents found by Biden\u2019s attorneys, and later, the FBI conducted its own searches of Biden\u2019s offices and residences.</p> <p>We laid out the details in our Jan. 19 story, \u201cTimeline of Biden\u2019s Classified Documents.\u201d</p> <p>Although details were not\u00a0publicly revealed\u00a0until early January, attorneys for Biden first\u00a0discovered\u00a0what the White House Counsel\u2019s Office called \u201ca small number of documents with classified markings\u201d at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C. on Nov. 2. The White House Counsel\u2019s Office notified the National Archives, which took possession of the documents the following morning.</p> <p>On Nov. 4, the National Archives Office contacted a prosecutor at the Department of Justice and informs him that documents which bear classified markings are now secured in a National Archives facility.</p> <p>According to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the FBI on Nov. 9\u00a0began\u00a0\u201can assessment, consistent with standard protocols, to understand whether classified information had been mishandled in violation of federal law.\u201d In \u201cmid-November,\u201d the FBI also searched the Penn Biden Center offices,\u00a0according to CBS News\u2019 reporting. The FBI did not seek or need a search warrant, because Biden\u2019s representatives cooperated with the search. So in that case, there were two weeks between the discovery of documents and the FBI search of the offices \u2014 not 80 days. And, we would note, that was a shorter time than the gap between first-discovery and the FBI search of Pence\u2019s home.</p> <p>But that was not the end of Biden\u2019s classified documents problems.</p> <p>On Dec. 20, Biden\u2019s personal counsel informed the DOJ that additional documents from Biden\u2019s time as vice president bearing classification markings were found in the garage of Biden\u2019s home in Wilmington, Delaware. The FBI took possession of the documents, Garland\u00a0revealed\u00a0at a Jan. 12 press conference.</p> <p>Then, on Jan. 11, Biden\u2019s personal attorneys\u00a0searched\u00a0his Delaware homes in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, and in the Wilmington home, they came across a document with classified markings and immediately contacted the Department of Justice. The next day, DOJ came and took those documents from the home.</p> <p>On Jan. 20, investigators with the Department of Justice \u2013 with the cooperation of the Biden team \u2013 conducted a \u201cthorough search\u201d of Biden\u2019s Wilmington home and took \u201cpossession of materials it [the department] deemed within the scope of its inquiry, including six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials,\u201d according to\u00a0a statement\u00a0released by a personal attorney for Biden. On Feb. 1, the FBI searched Biden\u2019s house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.\u00a0According to an attorney for Biden, \u201cNo documents with classified markings were found\u201d in the three-and-a-half-hour search. The Justice Department \u201ctook for further review some materials and handwritten notes that appear to relate to his [Biden\u2019s] time as Vice President.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to Pence\u2019s statement, there was no 80-day delay between the dates when Biden\u2019s attorneys notified authorities they had discovered classified documents at a location and when the FBI showed up to either pick those documents up, or to conduct an independent search.</p> <p>As we have written, there are significant differences between Biden\u2019s situation and Trump\u2019s, as we detailed in our story \u201cClassified Documents Found at Former Biden Office, Drawing Comparisons to Trump.\u201d In Trump\u2019s case, the search warrant was issued after months of negotiations and a grand jury subpoena resulted in only a partial return of classified documents.</p> <p>There is also a matter of scale. According to\u00a0CBS News\u2019 reporting\u00a0and what we know from statements by Biden\u2019s lawyers, less than 30 classified documents were found in Biden\u2019s possession at different locations. By contrast, the Department of Justice\u00a0says\u00a0that in its search at Mar-a-Lago, officials took possession of 18 government documents marked as top secret, 53 marked as secret and 30 marked as confidential. That\u2019s a total of 101 classified documents.</p>"},{"location":"articles/factchecking-pences-presidential-announcement/#inflation","title":"Inflation","text":"<p>In the town hall, Pence wrongly said that \u201cinflation is at a 40-year high\u201d and \u201cit all started when President Joe Biden and the Democrats passed a $2 trillion bill in the name of COVID.\u201d Inflation was at a 40-year high, but not now. And the legislation he referenced didn\u2019t start it all \u2014 economists point to several reasons for high inflation, beginning with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt inflation has been high in the last few years. The Consumer Price Index rose 9.1% for the 12 months ending in June 2022, the largest increase since November 1981, 41 years prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p> <p>But the figures have dropped since then. Inflation was up 4.9% for the 12 months ending in April. Before Biden took office, inflation last had been that high in September 2008.</p> <p>Republicans have repeatedly pinned all of the blame for inflation on the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief law passed by Democrats in March 2021 that included $1,400 checks to most Americans, expanded unemployment benefits, and money for schools, small businesses and states. As we\u2019ve written before, many economists say the law played a role in boosting inflation, but it was hardly the only factor \u2014 with the economic repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic looming large. \u00a0</p> <p>The pandemic acutely affected supply, demand and labor, as people spent considerably less for months and then began spending considerably more. Also, gas prices were affected by supply/demand pandemic fallout, followed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions many countries, including the U.S., put on Russian oil.</p> <p>Economists we interviewed last summer told us that while the ARP contributed some to inflation, the country also needed some level of stimulus to help the economy recover from the pandemic.</p> <p>Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

She turned down 10,000 soldiers. If she didn\u2019t turn down the soldiers, you wouldn\u2019t have had January 6<sup>th</sup>. \u2026 Listen to me. I understand that the police testified against her \u2013 the chief, very strongly against her. Capitol Police, they\u2019re great people. They testified against her. And they burned all the evidence. Okay? They burned all the evidence. \u2026 They destroyed all the evidence about Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0</p> <p>Welker: What do you say to people who wonder why you, as commander-in-chief, you have authorities that Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t have, as commander-in-chief?</p> <p>Trump: No, no. She has authority over the Capitol.\u00a0</p> <p>Welker: Why didn\u2019t you send help in that moment, though?\u00a0</p> <p>Trump: Frankly, just so you understand, I assumed that she took care of it. \u2026</p> <p>Welker: She says that that request was never officially made, just so you know.\u00a0</p> <p>Trump: Oh, stop it. \u2026 The mayor of D.C. gave us a letter, saying that she turns it down, okay? We have it. Nancy Pelosi also was asked, and she turned it down. The police commissioner of Capitol Police \u2013 \u2026 Capitol Police said that he wanted it. And Nancy Pelosi wouldn\u2019t accept it. She\u2019s responsible for Jan. 6<sup>th</sup>.\u00a0</p> <p>As\u00a0we have written, the claim that Pelosi \u201chas authority over the Capitol\u201d is overstated. The speaker does not oversee security of the U.S. Capitol. The speaker appoints one member of the four-member Capitol Police Board, which oversees Capitol security. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, also appointed a member.</p> <p>As for Trump\u2019s claim that Pelosi turned down his request for 10,000 National Guard troops, the House select committee said it found \u201cno evidence\u201d of that, and noted that then-Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller said there was \u201cno direct order from the president\u201d to put 10,000 National Guard troops on the ready.</p> <p>Then-White House Senior Adviser Max Miller and Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, testified that two days before the Jan. 6 rally, Trump talked about his intent to march with the supporters to the Capitol, but was warned about safety concerns. They testified that Trump \u201cfloated the idea of having 10,000 National Guardsmen deployed to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by leftwing counter-protestors,\u201d the committee\u2019s report on its findings said. Miller said he rejected the idea.</p> <p>In other words, the committee noted, \u201cTrump briefly considered having the National Guard oversee his procession to the U.S. Capitol\u201d but he \u201cdid not order the National Guard to protect the U.S. Capitol, or to secure the joint session proceedings\u201d to count the Electoral College votes and certify the presidential election.</p> <p>In a book released earlier this year, former Capitol Police Chief Steven A. Sund\u00a0reiterated\u00a0his claim \u2014 made to the Jan. 6 committee \u2014 that he requested National Guard troops two days before the Jan. 6 event, but that the House and Senate sergeants at arms rejected it.</p> <p>In\u00a0testimony\u00a0to the Jan. 6 committee, Sund said House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving \u201cstated that he was concerned about the \u2018optics\u2019 of having National Guard present and didn\u2019t feel that the intelligence supported it.\u201d According to a Washington Post article on March 2, 2021, Sund said in his book that he \u201clater learned the two (sergeants at arms) believed that Pelosi would never allow it.\u201d But Sund did not say that Pelosi was ever asked about the request or that she blocked it.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Pelosi told the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0at the time that the claim that Pelosi rejected the assignment of National Guard troops due to the optics was \u201ccompletely made up,\u201d and\u00a0repeated\u00a0that response when asked about Trump\u2019s latest comments.</p> <p>In\u00a0a Sept. 17 interview\u00a0on MSNBC, Pelosi responded to Trump\u2019s claim that she is \u201cresponsible for January 6<sup>th</sup>\u201d by saying the former president \u201chas always been about projection. He knows he\u2019s responsible for [the Capitol attack], so he projects it onto others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, he used to say, \u2018Well, she turned down my troops.\u2019 No,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe begged him. [Democratic Sen.] Chuck Schumer and I begged him to send the troops, again and again.\u201d</p> <p>We reached out to a spokesman for Trump for clarification or backup for the former president\u2019s claim that the Jan. 6 committee \u201cburned all the evidence\u201d from Capitol Police that implicated Pelosi, but we did not get a response.</p> <p>However, it seems likely Trump was referring to\u00a0allegations\u00a0Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk made in a Fox News interview in August that the Jan. 6 committee failed to adequately preserve some documents, data and video depositions. That led to Trump posting this on\u00a0social media: \u201cThe January 6<sup>th</sup> Unselect Committee got rid of EVERYTHING! Discarded, Deleted, Thrown Out. A Flagrant Violation of the law.\u201d</p> <p>To be clear, Loudermilk did not allege that\u00a0all\u00a0of the committee\u2019s records were not preserved, as Trump claimed. Much of the committee\u2019s work was released publicly in its nearly 850-page\u00a0report, as well as more than 140 publicly released\u00a0transcripts\u00a0and documents. Rather, the issue comes down to a debate over the committee rules for what documents and materials need to be archived.</p> <p>As the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0noted, Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat and the committee chairman, wrote that, consistent with guidance from the House Office of the Clerk, \u201cthe Select Committee did not archive temporary committee records that were not elevated by the Committee\u2019s actions, such as use in hearings or official publications, or those that did not further its investigative activities.\u201d</p> <p>Specifically, the House committee did publicly release a\u00a0transcript\u00a0of Sund\u2019s interview.</p>"},{"location":"articles/factchecking-trump-on-meet-the-press/#on-pardoning-himself-as-president","title":"On Pardoning Himself as President","text":"<p>Trump said he could have pardoned himself before he left office and \u201cthat would\u2019ve saved me all of these lawyers, and all of these fake charges, these Biden indictments.

Do you know what? I was given an option to pardon myself. I could\u2019ve pardoned myself when I left. People said, \u201cWould you like to pardon yourself?\u201d I had a couple of attorneys that said, \u201cYou can do it if you want.\u201d I had some people that said, \u201cIt would look bad, if you do.\u201d Because I think it would look terrible. \u2026\u00a0The last day, I could\u2019ve had a pardon done that would\u2019ve saved me all of these lawyers, and all of these fake charges, these Biden indictments.

You know what I said? \u201cI have no interest in even thinking about it.\u201d I never even wanted to think about it. \u00a0</p> <p>As\u00a0we have written, whether a president could pardon himself remains an unresolved legal issue. In July 2017, one of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys at the time, Jay Sekulow,\u00a0said\u00a0on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the power to pardon oneself has \u201cnever been adjudicated\u201d and would likely be decided by the Supreme Court.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t clear that the president has the power to pardon himself,\u201d\u00a0Brian Kalt, a professor at Michigan State University College of Law who has written about self-pardons, told us via email. \u201cHe could have tried, but prosecutors could have pursued him anyway and then the courts would have had to decide whether the pardon was valid or not.\u201d</p> <p>But in any case, such a pardon would not have had any effect on three of the four indictments Trump now faces.</p> <p>\u201cEven if the pardon was valid it would not have affected state prosecutions at all,\u201d Kalt said.</p> <p>So a pardon would not have affected the\u00a034-count indictment brought by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. That case centers on\u00a0allegations\u00a0that Trump conspired to pay porn star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet during the 2016 presidential election about an alleged sexual encounter and then falsified business records to cover up state and federal election law violations.\u00a0</p> <p>A presidential pardon also would not have prevented an\u00a0indictment\u00a0brought by a special state grand jury in Georgia that\u00a0alleges\u00a0Trump and 18 co-defendants \u201crefused to accept that Trump lost\u201d the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden and conspired \u201cto unlawfully change the outcome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s pardon power applies to \u2018offenses against the United States,\u2019 or federal crimes, so it would not help him in Georgia or New York, where he faces state charges,\u201d Jeffrey Crouch, an assistant professor of American politics at American University and an expert on the presidential pardon power, told us via email.</p> <p>Harvard constitutional scholar Mark Tushnet said Trump\u2019s lawyers \u201cmight argue that the state indictments in both New York and Georgia rest on state statutes that have been preempted (that is, entirely displaced) by federal law and so are in effect indictments for offences against the United States, but I won\u2019t expect that any reasonable court would accept that argument.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, Kalt said, even if such a self-pardon was valid for federal charges, \u201cit could only cover actions done before the pardon was issued, so it would not be able to be applied to anything he did after leaving office.\u201d</p> <p>So a self-pardon in Trump\u2019s final days in office would not have prevented a 44-page federal\u00a0indictment\u00a0against Trump that alleges he unlawfully possessed and mishandled sensitive classified documents after he left office, and obstructed federal officials who tried to get them back.</p> <p>\u201cThe classified documents controversy happened after Trump left the White House, so he would need to become president again in order to try to grant clemency to himself concerning that event,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cAlthough the president does not need to wait for someone to be formally charged, stand trial or be sentenced, he does need to have something to pardon. He could not have granted clemency for a \u2018future\u2019 crime.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"articles/factchecking-trump-on-meet-the-press/#ukraine-aid","title":"Ukraine Aid","text":"<p>Trump called out Europe, which he said has not provided nearly as much financial support as the U.S. to Ukraine amid its war with Russia.</p> <p>\u201cI think that Europe has to do more,\u201d Trump said, when Welker asked if the security of the U.S. \u201cis linked to Ukraine\u2019s security.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe\u2019re in for $200 billion.

Among the surveys conducted of Ukrainian refugees in Poland, only 17% said they plan to stay in Poland.</p> <p>Certain media and social media users are disseminating a news item claiming that 50% of Ukrainian refugees who are currently in Poland plan to remain there forever. They draw these conclusions by distorting what experts actually say and misrepresenting polling data.</p> <p></p> <p>In fact, results of studies conducted among Ukrainians who crossed the border into Poland after the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine do not support these conclusions. Between April 15 and May 10, the Interdisciplinary War Research Laboratory in Ukraine conducted surveys among Ukrainians who left for Poland using the computer-assisted web interview (CAWI), which were distributed on social networks among Ukrainian refugees. A total of 737 completed responses were analyzed.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the respondents surveyed say they want to return to Ukraine after the end of the war. Almost \u2155 of those who fled the war intend to stay in Poland. Some plan to work and earn money, and only then return. A small number of respondents want to return as soon as possible, as they find conditions Poland unbearable,\u201d the study report says.</p> <p>\u201cWe can say that 50% intend to return, 32% intend to stay, and 17% did not know what they would do. It is also worth noting that the respondents indicated they would return to Ukraine when the war is over. However, it is difficult to unequivocally determine when this will happen,\u201d study authors add.</p> <p>Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that half of Ukrainian refugees will remain in Poland. This is an incorrect conclusion. Judging by the responses, 17% said they wanted to stay, 14% said wanted to work in Poland, and return home with earnings, and 3% plan to obtain Polish citizenship.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>\u201cIf we look at all Ukrainian displaced persons who left Ukraine for Europe, then 79% want to return, and 50% want to return from Poland to Ukraine. They are very quickly assimilated there\u201d said Natalya Zaitseva Chipak, the director of to Socioinform polling center. Zaitseva actually confirms the Interdisciplinary War Research Laboratory poll results about Ukrainian refugees planning to return from Poland, she does not say anything about the other 50%, of which a significant percentage is undecided.</p> <p></p> <p>Expert assessments of what percentage of Ukrainian refugees will remain abroad after the end of the war vary. Most experts agree that the duration of the war will influence refugees\u2019 decisions. An online study by the 4Service polling center conducted in late March \u2013 early April of 3,027 respondents from 36 European countries confirms this. 89% of those surveyed plan to return home after the war ends. 3% do not plan to return at all, another 4% are undecided but want to remain in Europe, and another 4% are completely undecided. 67% of Ukrainians think that if the war drags on, they will likely remain abroad.</p> <p>StopFake has debunked other previous fakes about Ukrainian refugees, such as Ukrainian refugees are being kicked out of hotels in Bulgaria, an Ukrainian refugees cut swastika into German field.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-50-of-ukrainian-refugees-plan-to-stay-in-poland/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-50-of-ukrainian-refugees-plan-to-stay-in-poland/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-50-of-ukrainian-refugees-plan-to-stay-in-poland/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-50-of-ukrainian-refugees-plan-to-stay-in-poland/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-50-of-ukrainian-refugees-plan-to-stay-in-poland/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-50-of-ukrainian-refugees-plan-to-stay-in-poland/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-6-year-old-russian-child-beaten-by-ukrainians/","title":"fake-6-year-old-russian-child-beaten-by-ukrainians","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-6-year-old-russian-child-beaten-by-ukrainians/#fake-6-year-old-russian-child-beaten-by-ukrainians","title":"Fake: 6-Year-Old Russian Child Beaten by Ukrainians","text":"<p>2022-03-28, 16:53</p> <p></p> <p>The Dutch Police told StopFake that no such incident had actually taken place.

I\u2019m [name]. I\u2019m [age] and live in [state] and I will NOT be voting for Biden,\u201d each featuring a supposed personal photo,\u201d the report stated.</p> <p>Even though there were dozens of posts that were confirmed to be from legitimate users, News Guard found 739 posts that typically showed signs of inauthenticity, such as using a photo of a person with a different name than the one listed on the account, claiming to be a U.S. voter while the user\u2019s bio listed a different country, or having a voter name in the post that did not match the name on the user\u2019s profile.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, \u201cAmelia\u201d claimed to be a 35-year-old U.S. voter. However, a reverse image search of her photo revealed that \u201cAmelia\u201d is actually a Russian woman named Irina Krasniak. Krasniak told NewsGuard in an Instagram message that she was not aware that her photo had been misappropriated,\u201d part of the report stated.</p> <p>\u201cTina Davis\u201d from Illinois misappropriated the photo of Tatiana Batir, whose Facebook profile says she lives in China.\u201d</p> <p>Other accounts that joined in on the trend appeared to be using AI-generated images of young women.\u00a0</p> <p>According to a social media analytics tool used by NewsGuard, 53 of the fake anti-Biden posts were amplified by accounts based in Russia, with additional amplification from accounts in Poland, Nigeria, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Azerbaijan showing that the campaign was promoted globally, not just within the U.S.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-accounts-flood-x-platform-with-anti-biden-campaign-report/#nurudeen-akewushola","title":"Nurudeen Akewushola","text":"<p>Nurudeen Akewushola is a fact-checker with FactCheckHub.

Although some posts\u00a0 pointed out that the control of social media and recording of calls have to do with the so-called \u201cYarova Law\u201d, which is a package of amendments to russian law that forces social media companies and phone operators to save message logs, phone calls and all user-generated traffic, and also give authorities access to this information. Which means that the limitations in question have to do with the Russian Federation and nothing at all with Ukraine.</li> <li>similar posts from October 2021 connect these rules with the \u201cImplementation of the Third part of the Yarova law\u201d\u00a0</li> <li>starting in October 2021, these messages started being shared in ukrainian Facebook communities, particularly ones with many residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.\u00a0</li> <li>similar posts were shared in January 2022 in the kazakh segment of Facebook during the protests in the country.

Government agencies can access private messages if they know the user\u2019s phone number and they are using an unprotected internet connection.</p> <p>Phone calls may be examined by the authorities if they are given the permission from a court to do so. In order to access information about the caller, as well as their location, they simply need to look at the logs that are automatically kept by mobile operators. As operators do not keep the text of the call, it can only be accessed through special equipment accessible to the SSU and the Interior Ministry.</p> <p>The post\u2019s author also claims that devices are connected to CDMX surveillance systems.

More than 206,000 of those refugees held Russian passports, 413,000 are citizens of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR, LNR), 117,000 are citizens of other countries.\u00a0</p> <p>According to Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Ludmila Denysova, every day some 20,000 Ukrainians are forcibly relocated to Russia from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with Ukrainians resettled now in 35 regions of the Russian Federation. Since Russia unleashed its full-scale war against Ukraine on February 24, more than 700,000 civilians from the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, including 150,000 children were taken to Russia.</p> <p></p> <p>The blueprint for resettling Ukrainians arriving in Russia was worked out well before the February 24 Russian invasion. The Russian government was preparing for the deportation of Ukrainians to Russia well in advance and to that end issued a decree on February 12 regulating the placement of up to 95,000 people (Russian citizens, Ukrainian citizens, Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic residents) in different Russian Federation regions. A March 4 press release summing up the meeting between Tatiana Moskalkova and the Rostov region governor announces that almost 13,000 people, including more than 6,000 children from the unrecognized Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics were dispatched from the Rostov region to other Russian Federation districts.\u00a0 Under the pretext of an alleged Ukrainian offensive against the Russian occupied territories in eastern Ukraine, a forced evacuation to Russia of mostly women and children from the unrecognized statelets began on February 18. Since then, everyone who enters the Russian Federation from Ukrainian territory is counted as a statistic in this forced evacuation process.</p> <p></p> <p>Since the beginning of the war, the southeastern port city of Mariupol has suffered the most from Russia\u2019s brutal invasion. According to the Mariupol City Council, 90% of the city\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed as has 40% of the residential housing. Tatyana Moskalkova\u2019s declarations that there have been no forced transfers of refugees to Russia disregard the fact that from the very beginning of the war, the Russian army has not allowed humanitarian corridors towards central Ukraine, thereby deliberately creating a humanitarian catastrophe. As reported by Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Administration, the first refugees from Mariupol were able to reach Zaporizhzhia using their own transport, only on March 14. In the first two weeks refugees could not leave Mariupol for territories controlled by Ukraine because cars trying to leave the city were regularly fired upon by Russian troops. Subsequently, the Russian military announced that humanitarian corridors would be allowed only in exchange for the surrender of Mariupol.</p> <p></p> <p>From the very beginning the Russian Federation opposed the evacuation of the city\u2019s population. \u201cWe don\u2019t have orders to allow you out of the city. Go back or we will shoot,\u201d Mariupol residents heard this at every Russian military checkpoint when they tried to escape from the city in early March, informs the Mariupol City Council.</p> <p>The humanitarian corridor situation is extremely difficult in all areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions occupied by Russian troops. According to the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, on April 13 there were no humanitarian corridors operating along the entire front line. \u201cIn the Zaporizhzhia region the invaders blocked evacuation buses, and in the Luhansk region they violated the ceasefire,\u201d Vereshchuk points out. In Melitopol, the second largest city in the Zaporizhzhia province, Russian troops prevented people from leaving for the relatively safe territory of Ukraine and instead forced them to sign up for evacuation to Russian occupied Crimea.</p> <p></p> <p>The evacuation of civilians from territories occupied by invading Russian troops has been problematic and raised numerous questions from the very beginning of the war. In parts of Mariupol captured by the Russian forces, many civilians had no choice but to go to territories not controlled by Ukraine or to go to Russia. Many did so under pressure from the Russian military, who forced them to leave their shelters and hiding places and directed them to \u201cfiltration camps\u201d for identification and interrogation. Those who passed the filtration were then transported to various Russian regions, those who did not were imprisoned.</p> <p>Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko also confirmed in mid-March that the Mariupol residents captured during the war were taken to filtration camps, where Russian troops checked their documents and mobile phones. \u201cAfter these checks, some Mariupol residents were sent on to remote Russian cities, the fate of others remains unknown,\u201d Boychenko said. Mariupol deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov informed that 30,000-40-000 people had already been deported to Russia. Mayor Boychenko confirmed this information. On April 7 Deputy Mayor Orlov advised that the deported Ukrainians are first sent to a general round-up camp and from there to a filtration camp. Those that fail to pass through the invaders\u2019 filtration schemes end up in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic\u2019s prisons.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>All of this information is also confirmed by eyewitnesses who were in such Russian \u201cfiltration camps\u201d which are and Manhush. It has also been confirmed that a Russian filtration camp is also established in Dokuchayevsk in the Donetsk region. When civilians are brought to these camps, their documents are confiscated. Russian security personnel from the FSB (Russian security service) determine who is to be sent where. They are particularly on the lookout for Ukrainian military, veterans, and law enforcement personnel. These people are then transported to the Russian Federation, particularly to Taganrog (Rostov region) and the Krasnodar territory.</p> <p></p> <p>Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk also confirmed the existence of Russian filtration camps. \u201cThey are filtered there, just like in Nazi Germany, they are sorted into those deemed trustworthy and those thought to be unreliable. Their documents are taken from them, they are checked for tattoos. And if, God forbid, a person has something in the form of a trident or our coat of arms, that person simply disappears and can no longer be found. Children are taken away from their parents, children from orphanages and boarding schools are also taken away to unknown locations\u201d Vereshchuk said.</p> <p></p> <p>Tatiana Moskalkova disputes the facts that allow a different look at Moscow\u2019s \u201cvoluntary evacuation.\u201d At the end of March, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said that \u201cthe Russian military helps civilians to leave freely when they try to leave these settlements, because otherwisw they are simply shot in the back.\u201d Thus, the Kremlin is hiding behind the narrative that Ukrainian troops are allegedly shelling civilians who find themselves in a combat zone.</p> <p>Meanwhile campaign materials began to appear in official Russian sources calling for further migration to the Russian far east. People who agree to such a resettlement are promised 170,000 rubles start-up capital, 8,500 rubles of social benefits in the absence of income, a housing certificate for 160,000 rubles and a far east annual 2% mortgage. According to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate, after passing through the filtration camps, Ukrainians are sent to economically depressed Russian regions. A number of northern regions, in particular Sakhalin, are named as the final destination. Ukrainians are offered official employment through employment centers. Those who agree are issued documents that prohibit their departure from Russia for two years.</p> <p>Ukrainian Ombudsman Ludmila Denysova reports that a similar \u201cdistribution\u201d for Ukrainian residents arriving from Ukrainian controlled territories is already taking place through forced passportization. On April 10, Denysova stated that \u201cby intimidating the most vulnerable categories of persons \u2013 women, persons with disabilities and pensioners, the aggressor authorities received almost 14,000 applications for Russian citizenship and issued 12,000 passports.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-all-ukrainian-refugees-willingly-going-to-russia/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-all-ukrainian-refugees-willingly-going-to-russia/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-all-ukrainian-refugees-willingly-going-to-russia/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-all-ukrainian-refugees-willingly-going-to-russia/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-all-ukrainian-refugees-willingly-going-to-russia/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-all-ukrainian-refugees-willingly-going-to-russia/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-almost-all-mariupol-refugees-want-to-go-to-russia/","title":"fake-almost-all-mariupol-refugees-want-to-go-to-russia","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-almost-all-mariupol-refugees-want-to-go-to-russia/#fake-almost-all-mariupol-refugees-want-to-go-to-russia","title":"Fake: Almost All Mariupol Refugees Want to Go to Russia","text":"<p>2022-03-17, 17:06</p> <p></p> <p>The majority of refugees from Mariupol who are fleeing the brutal Russian bombardment of their city, are leaving for Ukrainian cities that are controlled by Ukrainian authorities.</p> <p>On March 16, citing the Russian Defense Ministry, several Russian media \u2013 RIA Novosti, TASS and others \u2013 featured stories claiming that the majority of refugees from Mariupol who were leaving the city through established humanitarian corridors, wanted to go to Russia.</p> <p></p> <p>Screenshot \u2013 ria.ru</p> <p>\u201cAlmost 31.4 thousand civilians were evacuated from Mariupol by humanitarian corridors, 99% of them expresses a desire to go to Russia or territories controlled by Russia\u201d TASS reported, citing the head of the Russian National Defense Management Center General Mikhail Mizintsev.</p> <p>These claims are simply not true. Mariupol has been under constant fire from aircraft and artillery, it was finally possible to evacuate civilians in an organized manner only on March 14, 2022. According to the Mariupol City Council, more than 160 private cars were able to leave the city on the Portovske-Manhush-Berdyansk-Tokmak route, with Zaporizhzhia being the final destination. Zaporizhzhia is under the control of the Ukrainian government.</p> <p>According to Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Reintegration and Temporarily Occupied Territories, the following day, March 15, 2022 about 20,000 people were evacuated through an organized humanitarian corridor with Zaporizhzhia as their destination. The following day, March 16, the Zaporizhzhia City Council announced the arrival of 1,565 cars and 4,329 people from Mariupol. Many of the evacuees were forced to spend the night in Berdyansk, continuing their journey to Zaporizhzhia the following day. According to Ukrainian authorities, as of the evening of March 16, 6,426 Mariupol residents had arrived at their final evacuation point, and a convoy of buses was still traveling towards Zaporizhzhia.</p> <p>Russian media is also falsely claiming that Ukrainian citizens fleeing the Russia unleashed war from other Ukrainian cities are reluctant to travel to the European Union. TASS quotes General Mikhail Mizintsev who claims that \u201cordinary people are looking for any opportunity to evacuate north and east to the Russian Federation and do not even consider other options for escape to the west, including the European Union\u201d. This claim is patently untrue.

Turkey has absolutely no pretensions towards the Ukrainian peninsula and has often supported and helped the Crimean Tatars, whose rights Russia violates on a massive scale.</p> <p>Ukraine has dragged Turkey into a union against Crimea. Turkey is cooperating with Ukraine to spite the Kremlin and Ankara does not really recognize Crimea as Ukrainian, but rather considers the peninsula its own territory, dreaming of making it a part of Turkey. The clown and the sultan. This is how Russian media reacted to the news that the Turkish government is ready to cooperate with Ukraine on Crimea.</p> <p></p> <p>Gazeta.ru, Ukraina.ru, RIA Novosti, \u00a0Moskovskyi Komsomolets, RIA Krym and others all featured this fake narrative.</p> <p>These stories began appearing in Russian media after Turkish President Erdogan announced that Turkey is ready to work with Ukraine within the framework of the Crimean Platform consultative body. Last July Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry launched the Crimean Platform, an international consultative mechanism focused on the consequences of Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea, with the aim of the initiative eventually becoming a negotiation platform on the de-occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula. According to the Ministry, the initiative will work on the level of heads of state, foreign ministries, parliaments and experts. A multi-level summit on the Crimean issue is planned for 2021.</p> <p>According to Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Secretary Emine Djaparova, \u201cThe Crimean Platform will strengthen international non-recognition \u00a0policy of \u00a0Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, create additional opportunities to quickly respond to growing security threats posed by Russia\u2019s militarization in the Black and Azov Seas, and consolidate political pressure on the Kremlin, including sanctions to counteract further gross human rights violations\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>The European Union, the US, Canada and the United Kingdom intend to join the consultative platform, separate EU countries such as Poland, Romania Germany, France and Sweden have also confirmed their solidarity with Ukraine and their intention to join. On October 16 Turkey joined the Crimean coalition resulting in a flurry of negativity in the Russian media about alleged \u201cselfish Turkish interests\u201d in Crimea. Without making any claims on the Crimea, Turkey has in fact repeatedly and officially stated that it does not support Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukrainian peninsula and opposes the Kremlin\u2019s occupation. Turkish authorities also emphasize that Turkey\u2019s priority is respect for the rights of Crimean Tatars, whose rights the Kremlin is currently massively violating.</p> <p>\u201cFor Turkey the priority remains ensuring that the Crimean Tatars living in Crimea continue to live in prosperity and security in their historic homeland, protect their cultural identity and to end their suffering as a result of the occupation\u201d the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement on the sixth anniversary of Russia\u2019s illegal occupation of Crimea.</p> <p>According to Ukrainian human rights organization KrymSOS, i the largest number of criminal cases against Crimean Tatars since the beginning of the occupation was recorded in 2019. In 2019, Russia illegally detained about 30 Crimean Tatars on trumped-up charges of links to Hizb ut Tahrir (pp. 16-17). In just one year, hundreds of illegal searches, detentions and arrests, and dozens of politically motivated cases have been reported in Crimea. 70% of all political prisoners are Crimean Tatars.

In addition, the OSCE cameras in question were incapable of recording video at long distances; \u00a0for this purpose UAVs would have been used.</p> <p>Russian media accused the Organization on Security and Cooperating in Europe\u00a0 (OSCE) of sharing, with the the Armed Forces of Ukraine, data on the location of Russian forces, allowing them to correct artillery strikes. According to Russian media, the OSCE\u2019s Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) provided the Ukrainian military with data from its video surveillance cameras.\u00a0 Their stories claimed \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d \u201cproved\u201d\u00a0 these accusations.\u00a0 In effect, Russian propagandists are trying to convince everyone that the OSCE carried out subversive activities in Donbas.</p> <p>Kremlin authorities and the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR) have had strained relations from the very beginning with the OSCE SMM, which has been working in Ukraine since March 21, 2014.\u00a0\u00a0 And since the signing of the Minsk 2 agreement in February 2015, the Special Monitoring Mission has been the independent party that monitored the implementation of the commitments to ceasefire and the withdrawal of weapons from the demarcation line. Russia\u2019s hybrid forces in Donbas, however, regularly obstructed the activities of \u00a0SMM representatives on territory not controlled by Ukraine, something the mission repeatedly recorded in its reports. \u00a0In February 2022, before the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the SMM reported numerous cases of ceasefire violations by Russian and proxy forces. \u00a0\u00a0On February 25,\u00a0 the OSCE \u00a0evacuated all its monitors from Ukraine.\u00a0 On March 31, 2022, the mandate of the SMM in the Donbas expired.</p> <p></p> <p>On March 1 a representative of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Militia\u201d of the DNR, Eduard Basurin, claimed that OSCE representatives might have transmitted coordinates of military targets in Donetsk to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. \u00a0DNR officials alluded to the presence of documents allegedly indicating coordinates of military targets provided by the SMM to Ukrainian forces.\u00a0 \u00a0Major Russian propaganda outlets \u2013 Izvestia, RT, TASS, Gazeta.ru, RIA Novosti, Rossiya 1, Zvezda, and others \u2013 published these accusations against the SMM. \u00a0Subsequently, on April 9, the head of the DNR, Denis Pushilin, issued an order declaring OSCE activities on the territory of the \u201crepublic\u201d illegal and the presence of its representatives there \u201cundesirable.\u201d \u00a0Accusing the OSCE of cooperating with Ukraine\u2019s armed forces may be an attempt to discredit the international organization and shift the responsibility for the failures of the Russian military to a third party.</p> <p></p> <p>RT story: \u201cThe OSCE might have transmitted to the Armed Forces of Ukraine data on the location of the forces of the DNR.\u201d</p> <p>The story that the OSCE, even after its withdrawal from the Donbas, might have shared with the Ukrainian military data on the location of Russian forces appeared on RT on April 10, 2022. It consisted of a text version and a short compilation of videos that were allegedly sent to the Ukrainian military from an OSCE surveillance camera installed at one of the points on the demarcation line.</p> <p>RT stated: \u201cOn March 9, a device with a high-resolution video camera was found in a car trailer (drz OSCE285MU).\u00a0A video file was found on the camera, indicating corrections of artillery strikes from Ukrainian positions against the settlements of Sakhanka and Bezimenne, Donetsk Region.\u201d RT also claimed that later, on March 19, a Lenovo laptop was found in the village of Zachativka, \u00a0with special data collection software, the Virage-Tablet automated subsystem. Allegedly, this laptop received video from the surveillance camera found in the trailer.\u00a0The RT story, however, contains obvious inconsistencies.</p> <p>Firstly, \u00a0the Virage-tablet system, developed in Kharkiv,\u00a0 was designed to monitor Ukrainian air space, by displaying the movement of potential air targets in real time. It has been part of the air defense of Ukraine since 2016 and has no connection to the collection of data from security cameras.</p> <p>Secondly, the story contains fragments of recordings of video surveillance of Russian military convoys on March 15 and March 20, 2022 (as shown in the upper left corner). That is, these videos were made after the dates given by RT \u2013 March 9 for the discovery of the OSCE video camera and March 19 for the Lenovo laptop.</p> <p></p> <p>Furthermore, \u00a0comments on the video indicate the events took place near the village of Krasnohorivka and a Cargill plant, not far from Donetsk. \u00a0It is there that the military convoy was being monitored, the one targeted by Ukrainian artillery. \u00a0That is too far from the OSCE camera, the one which, according to RT, helped to direct fire against Sakhanka and Bezimenne. It\u2019s 107 km from Bezimenne to Krasnohorivka.\u00a0 Surveillance cameras cannot capture images at such distances; UAVs or satellite data are needed for that.</p> <p></p> <p>Videos from other SMM cameras can be found on the internet.\u00a0Night footage of the shelling of the Donetsk Filtration Station in 2018 and the town of Stanytsia Luhanska in 2017 shows that such cameras are incapable of capturing images from long distances. For such purposes the OSCE had other technical means available to carry out more accurate observations of the territory. This suggests that the videos shown in the RT post are unlikely to have been taken by the discovered camera.</p> <p></p> <p>It is worth noting that, according to OSCE officials, CCTV cameras along the demarcation line were installed on special structures, 18 meters high, with a viewing angle of 360 degrees and a vertical range of up to 2 km.\u00a0Such cameras are only able to determine the direction from which \u00a0shots came and what equipment was brought to the line of demarcation. One of the videos on the SMM YouTube channel show what the towers with the surveillance cameras look like. The OSCE began installing cameras along the entire line back in 2015.\u00a0Twenty-five \u00a0cameras were installed along the 500 km line of contact. The number was gradually increased on both sides, despite known cases when Russian mercenaries disabled them. The SMM\u2019s principal deputy chief monitor, Alexander Hug, reported that encrypted data from the cameras goes to the OSCE through closed communication channels and is the property of the organization. In addition, OSCE officials explained that all information from the cameras was transmitted first to the OSCE hub in Mariupol and only then to Donetsk and Kyiv. The RT story, therefore, contains no evidence of the transfer of video recordings from any SMM cameras directly to the Ukrainian military.</p> <p>Aleksandr Sladkov\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d: \u201cThe underhandedness of the OSCE.\u201d</p> <p>A week after the release of the RT story, the war correspondent of the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK), Aleksandr Sladkov, posted a full-fledged \u201cinvestigation,\u201d titled \u201cThe Underhandedness of the OSCE,\u201d \u00a0on his Telegram channel, in which he tried to provide additional arguments of OSCE \u201ccooperation\u201d with the Ukrainian military.\u00a0 We, however, found still more inconsistencies in his video review.</p> <p>Sladkov confirms the location of the camera from which the Ukrainian military allegedly received video recordings for targeting enemy forces as the village of Bezimenne, Donetsk Region, which is currently under Russian occupation. He mentions the same car trailer number (grz OSCE285MU) that appears in the RT story.</p> <p></p> <p>According to Sladkov (00:50), the surveillance camera itself had 200x magnification and was later removed from its tower by representatives of the so-called DNR.\u00a0Video recordings from SMM cameras, however, show that they do not have 200x magnification capability and have rather limited visibility. Sladkov says (01:00) that the discovered camera was directed towards the village of Sakhanka and filmed the movement of Russian armored columns there. \u00a0The distance between Sakhanka and Bezimenne being 7 km, it is difficult to imagine how the OSCE camera (whose technical specs are mentioned above) could capture video even at that distance.</p> <p></p> <p>At 01:22 of his video Sladkov claims that the bullet marks on the camera were made by Ukrainian soldiers, who, upon leaving the area, tried to disable it. \u00a0Here it is worth pointing out that both Sakhanka and Bezimenne have been under the constant control of Russian fighters since 2014. The control was so harsh that SMM representatives were not always able to pass through the Bezimenne checkpoint, \u201cdue to the lack of permission from militia commanders.\u201d\u00a0Ukrainian forces, therefore, simply could not have accessed this place, especially not after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The bullet marks on the camera were clearly not left by the Ukrainian military.</p> <p>At 03:11 Sladkov shows a Lenovo laptop, the one already familiar to us from the RT story, which placed it in the village of Zachativka, 70 km from Bezimenne. He\u00a0 claims the laptop contains videos transmitted to the Ukrainian military from the OSCE camera. The video Sladkov plays, however, shows the dates\u00a0 June 16, 2018 (at 03:55) and June 27, 2018 (04:25). That is, these videos have nothing to do with current events. In addition, all this time Sladkov had been working in the interface of the ESRI program, from an American geographic information systems company. Most likely it was used by the Ukrainian military to visualize geodata and to create modern maps of the area, and not to transmit data for artillery targeting.</p> <p>Further on, at 05:10 and 06:55, we see other videos that were previously presented in the RT story. Dated March 20 and March 15, 2022, respectively, they show the area of the village of Krasnohorivka and the Cargill plant, with a convoy of Russian vehicles advancing. The videos shot there clearly could not be related to the camera from Bezimenne.</p> <p></p> <p>Sladkov\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d provides new \u201cmaterial evidence,\u201d a cellphone supposedly belonging to a Ukrainian army officer and found in Maryinka, a town located near Krasnohorivka, Kurakhovo and the Cargill plant, in the vicinity of Donetsk. Commenting on this discovery, Sladkov assures that \u201cthe videos found on the phone are identical to the videos stored in the OSCE camera.\u201d\u00a0However, as it was clarified earlier, these videos cannot in any way be connected to the camera found near the village of Bezimenne.</p> <p>At 08:36\u00a0 in Sladkov\u2019s story we are introduced to the \u201cmain witness\u201d to the OSCE\u2019s \u201ccooperation\u201d with the Ukrainian military \u2013 Vadim Golda,\u00a0 \u201cformer assistant to the SMM security officer in the Donbas.\u201d \u00a0However, according to his resume found on a\u00a0 job search site, Vadim Golda worked in this position for only two months, from the end of March to the beginning of June 2014, that is before the installation of video surveillance cameras along the entire demarcation line had even begun, in 2015.\u00a0 So, he could have hardly known anything about their work and technical characteristics. Despite this, in Sladkov\u2019s story, Golda supposedly claims that \u201cthe OSCE video surveillance system was completely subordinated to Kyiv, and the data from its cameras went only to Kyiv.\u201d This, however, is refuted by data received from OSCE representatives.</p> <p></p> <p>Sladkov\u2019s story makes it clear that neither the videos presented; nor the camera allegedly found in Bezimenne; nor the cellphone; nor the laptop support the charge that the OSCE was in some way involved in helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine correct their artillery fire on the positions of Russian troops.</p> <p>VGTRK Feature: \u201cThe OSCE in the Service of Kyiv: How the Spies Worked.\u201d</p> <p>A shortened version of Aleksandr Sladkov\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d was shown April 15, 2022,\u00a0 on the program Vesti on the federal channel Rossiya 1. Sladkov slightly changed the narrations and added a few more blunders to his already clumsy \u201cinvestigation.\u201d At 00:49 minutes of the story he says that surveillance cameras appeared along the entire demarcation line in the Donbas in 2018.\u00a0 We already know that this is not the case \u2013 their installation began back in 2015. \u00a0Further on, at 00:55 minutes, he claims that \u201cimages from the cameras were accumulated in Europe,\u201d although, as we know, they were processed at the OSCE hub in Mariupol, then transmitted to Donetsk and Kyiv.</p> <p></p> <p>Sladkov also states that the SMM supposedly \u201cforgot one of its cameras near the village of Bezimenne\u201d (01:01).\u00a0 But the point is not the forgetfulness of the OSCE. The mission was evacuated from Donbas on an emergency basis after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \u00a0According to Russian media reports, the SMM left the \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d on March 1 and has had no access to their equipment since. Sladkov is well aware of this. According to an order by Denys Pushilin, the so-called head of the DNR, OSCE representatives were obliged to remove all SMM property by April 30, 2022. \u00a0\u00a0After April 9, according to this order, all OSCE activities on the territory of the unrecognized \u201crepublic\u201d are considered unlawful. The stories broadcast by RT and the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company contain no evidentiary basis for accusing the Special Monitoring Mission of the OSCE of assisting the Ukrainian military.\u00a0 Any \u201cevidence\u201d of its \u201ccollaboration\u201d with the Armed Forces of Ukraine does not stand up to scrutiny; the campaign to discredit the activities of the SMM in Ukraine is can only be related to a need to justify the ban on the further presence of the Mission on the territory of Donbas.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-armed-forces-of-ukraine-used-osce-video-camera-data-for-artillery-fire-correction/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-armed-forces-of-ukraine-used-osce-video-camera-data-for-artillery-fire-correction/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-armed-forces-of-ukraine-used-osce-video-camera-data-for-artillery-fire-correction/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-armed-forces-of-ukraine-used-osce-video-camera-data-for-artillery-fire-correction/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-armed-forces-of-ukraine-used-osce-video-camera-data-for-artillery-fire-correction/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-armed-forces-of-ukraine-used-osce-video-camera-data-for-artillery-fire-correction/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-arms-supplies-to-ukraine-are-a-black-hole-americans-say/","title":"fake-arms-supplies-to-ukraine-are-a-black-hole-americans-say","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-arms-supplies-to-ukraine-are-a-black-hole-americans-say/#fake-arms-supplies-to-ukraine-are-a-black-hole-americans-say","title":"Fake: Arms Supplies to Ukraine Are a Black Hole, Americans Say","text":"<p>2022-08-23, 16:32</p> <p></p> <p>Russian media have taken one reader comment to a magazine article about military aid to Ukraine and presented it as the opinion of all Americans. Recent opinion polls continue to show high levels of support for Ukraine as well as support for the supply of weapons to Ukraine.</p> <p>Yet another new Russian fake concerning western military support for Ukraine is making the rounds on pro-Kremlin media. The Russian newspaper Izvestia is claiming that Americans have compared Ukraine to a black hole and are criticizing Western weapons supplies to Ukraine. According to the Izvestia newspaper,\u00a0 Americans are calling military help to Ukraine \u201ca waste of money.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>In this case Russian propagandists resorted to one of their most popular manipulation techniques, selective use of a reader\u2019s comment under an article in a foreign publication in order to present it as an example of majority opinion.</p> <p>The article at the center of this fake is a story in the American Newsweek magazine Aid pledges to Ukraine \u2018dry up\u2019 as Tracker shows US leading support, citing information from the Ukraine Support Tracker, a database of military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, about declining commitments of aid to Ukraine. According to the article, Western European states, particularly Germany and France have not provided significant assistance to Ukraine. Christoph Trebesch, who heads the Ukraine Support Tracker team, argues in the article that the EU is providing little assistance to Ukraine when compared with its 800-billion-euro coronavirus support fund. Nevertheless, the article notes that critical weapons continue to be delivered and in September, there will be new pledges of military aid.</p> <p></p> <p>Anyone can comment on a Newsweek article, it does not matter where you live or what nationality you are, you register on the site and leave your comment. Russian media chose to focus only on one comment out of 89, that of one @HHvictor, who wrote the following: The Ukraine has been such a waste of money, billions and billions, that it is essentially a black hole with an event horizon which lets nothing come back out and beyond which anything, money, equipment or men, simply disappear.\u00a0 That is clearly an unsustainable drain on the economies of the West. Looking at HHvictor\u2019s other comments on Newsweek articles about Ukraine, one cannot help but note a pattern which echoes Russian propagandist narratives about Ukraine: that the Ukrainian military are \u201cterrorists\u201d, the West and NATO are to blame for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Russian media have once again presented the comment of one user, who is clearly disseminating Russian propaganda narratives, as the opinion of all Americans, and this is simply not true.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons conducted an investigation with the participation of world experts and in the spring of 2019 confirmed in its final report that chlorine had in fact been used in an attack on the Syrian city. Evidence of the attack was presented in a report numbering hundreds of pages, but the Kremlin still stubbornly denies these facts.</p> <p>The White Helmets have been singled out as a particular source of Russian disinformation. Because of its humanitarian activities, which include documenting Russian war crimes in Syria, the Kremlin has dubbed this humanitarian organization as \u201cfake guns\u201d with terrorist connections. The Kremlin is now accusing the White Helmets of teaching Ukrainians \u201cto make fakes against Russia.\u201d This outrageous claim is not supported by anything even remotely resembling evidence. The White Helmets, who have vast experience in helping civilians during war time, have begun producing \u201ceducational guidance materials for paramedics and civilians on dealing with injured people and proper behavior in cases of Russian bombing.\u201d The goals of this humanitarian organization have absolutely nothing to do with \u201cspreading fakes against Russia\u201d.</p> <p>The work of the White Helmets has never been connected with the spread of disinformation or fakes. The movement began in 2012, when volunteers began organizing in order to rescue people trapped under rubble after bombing raids. White Helmet activists were among the first to document the Assad government\u2019s and their Russian allies\u2019 use of chemical weapons in Syria. Because of this, they have been the target of an extensive and relentless Russian propaganda campaign.\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-atrocities-in-bucha-chemical-attack-in-syria-and-the-work-of-white-helmets-all-staged-by-west/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-atrocities-in-bucha-chemical-attack-in-syria-and-the-work-of-white-helmets-all-staged-by-west/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-atrocities-in-bucha-chemical-attack-in-syria-and-the-work-of-white-helmets-all-staged-by-west/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-atrocities-in-bucha-chemical-attack-in-syria-and-the-work-of-white-helmets-all-staged-by-west/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-atrocities-in-bucha-chemical-attack-in-syria-and-the-work-of-white-helmets-all-staged-by-west/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-atrocities-in-bucha-chemical-attack-in-syria-and-the-work-of-white-helmets-all-staged-by-west/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-austria-agrees-to-pay-for-russian-gas-in-rubles/","title":"fake-austria-agrees-to-pay-for-russian-gas-in-rubles","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-austria-agrees-to-pay-for-russian-gas-in-rubles/#fake-austria-agrees-to-pay-for-russian-gas-in-rubles","title":"Fake: Austria Agrees To Pay for Russian Gas In Rubles","text":"<p>2022-04-27, 14:37</p> <p></p> <p>Austria continues to pay for Russian gas only in Euros and strictly adheres to agreed EU sanctons, said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

In the midst of Moscow\u2019s destructive war against Ukraine, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry has launched a new variation on that theme, claiming that experiments were conducted on bats with the coronavirus in laboratories created by the US in Ukraine. There are no secret laboratories in Ukraine. All information about the cooperation between the US and Ukraine in preventing the spread of pathogens and the technologies involved in that endeavor are readily available online and in the public domain.

Medvedchuk, who was under house arrest, has fled Ukraine as the war began.</p> <p>The US Embassy in Ukraine refuted this Russian fake back in 2020, stating then and now, that the US is openly working with the Ukrainian government to consolidate and safeguard pathogens and toxins that could pose security threats, while at the same time providing the opportunity for peaceful research and vaccine development.</p> <p>\u201cOur joint efforts help to ensure that dangerous pathogens do not fall into the wrong hands.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud to partner with the Ministry of Health, State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection, National Academy of Agrarian Sciences, and the Ministry of Defense to make us all safer,\u201d the US Embassy said in an official statement.</p> <p>As for the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 pandemic, recent research indicates that it is of natural origin and was first recorded in the Huannan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China.

He also stressed that these missiles do not differ that much from other launched missiles, except that they are difficult to shoot down with air defense systems.</p> <p>Russian media are disseminating stories claiming that US President Joe Biden allegedly admitted that he is \u201cafraid\u201d of Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. \u201cWhite House chief admits that the US Army is unable to stop the Kinzhal hypersonic missile\u201d writes Tsargrad.</p> <p></p> <p>President Biden never said that he was \u201cafraid\u201d of Russian hypersonic missiles. Quite the contrary, he called the use of these weapons in Ukraine a sign that \u201cPutin is backed against the wall\u201d because the Russian army is not achieving the success he expected in Ukraine and he is now pursuing more aggressive tactics. Biden also emphasized that these missiles are not fundamentally different from those already known, except that they are difficult to shoot down with air defense systems. \u201cAnd, if you notice, they\u2019ve just launched a \u2014 their hypersonic missile, because it\u2019s the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 as you all know, it\u2019s a consequential weapon.\u00a0 And \u2014 but \u2014 with the same warhead on it as a \u2014 as any other launched missile.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t make that much difference, except it\u2019s almost impossible to stop it.\u00a0 There\u2019s a reason they\u2019re using it\u201d President Biden said.</p> <p>According to The Insider global news publication, the missile Russia fired at Ukraine is simply a modified version of an air-launched ballistic missile. The Kinzhal missile travels at hypersonic speed, but it does not belong to the advanced class of weapons. \u201cThe truth is, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile is actually little more than a conventional air-launched ballistic missile with a design that dates back to the 1980s\u2026\u00a0 Hypersonic speed isn\u2019t actually all that special, but there are new weapons that leverage hypersonic speeds to achieve objectives in new or different ways. The Kinzhal, however, just isn\u2019t one of them\u201d writes military analyst Alex Hollings. According to Hollings, the Kinzhal is a modified version of the 9K720 Iskander short range ballistic missile with a new guidance system designed specifically for air-to-ground operations. This Russian missile, like others, operates using a conventional rocket propulsion system and a suppressed ballistic flight path.</p> <p>Hollings says the Kinzhal missile is more of a marketing gimmick than next-generation technology, because Russia simply cannot afford to mass-produce modern aircraft such as the Su-57 fighters or tanks such as the T-14 Armata without foreign investments. To attract foreign buyers Russian must project an image of a country that is able to develop weapons that are equal to or better than those of such powerful countries as the United States and China.</p> <p>Moreover, as Tom Karako, a defense expert and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u00a0 who directs the center\u2019s International Security program explained to the Washington Post, although the Kinzhal is harder to shoot down with air defenses, however, \u201cit\u2019s a huge delusion to think that these things cannot be defeated, after all, they are just rockets\u201d Karako said.</p> <p>Belgian defense strategy analyst Joseph Henrotin also noted on Twitter that Russia may be running out of Iskander short range ballistic missiles or looking to up the ante by deploying a nuclear capable hypersonic missile. The respected Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer also emphasized that use of the Kinzhal missile would not change much on the territory of Ukraine, except to have a psychological and propaganda effect. Felgenhauer also thinks the use of this missile may indicate that Russian troops are running out of other types of weapons.</p> <p>In view of this, the British Defense Ministry stated that the use of the Kinzhal is unlikely to significantly affect the outcome of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-admits-he-s-afraid-of-russian-kinzhal-rocket/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-admits-he-s-afraid-of-russian-kinzhal-rocket/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-admits-he-s-afraid-of-russian-kinzhal-rocket/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-admits-he-s-afraid-of-russian-kinzhal-rocket/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-admits-he-s-afraid-of-russian-kinzhal-rocket/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-admits-he-s-afraid-of-russian-kinzhal-rocket/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-quote-criticizing-ukraine-s-government/","title":"fake-biden-quote-criticizing-ukraine-s-government","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-quote-criticizing-ukraine-s-government/#fake-biden-quote-criticizing-ukraines-government","title":"Fake: Biden Quote Criticizing Ukraine\u2019s Government","text":"<p>2022-03-28, 10:48</p> <p></p> <p>Netizens are massively disseminating alleged statements by US President Joe Biden criticizing the Ukrainian government. \u201cUkraine has not done enough to protect itself!

Ukraine was preparing for a full-scale-war with Russia but could not openly communicate this to the public. \u201cWe could not tell society that tomorrow there will be war. This was unacceptable, because this was one of the Russian Federation\u2019s tactics, so that chaos would begin here. We held on to the very last, we prepared until the very last. We clearly understood that this would happen.\u201d Danilov said.</p> <p>Secretary Danilov said Ukrainian authorities began assessing the risk of war as real in November 2021, believing that Russia would carry out an offensive in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk and the direction of Crimea. \u201cThe only thing I can say is that we did not expect this to happen directly from Belarus. We did not expect such a \u201cstab in the back\u201d. We did not expect them to go on all fronts.

Misrepresenting the content of Joe Biden\u2019s speech, Russian media stated that the American President allegedly \u201cadmitted that he deceived the world under the guise of fighting for democracy\u201d and called assistance to Ukraine \u201can investment in murder and the American military-industrial complex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInvestments in the military conflicts in Israel and Ukraine are necessary for the well-being of the American economy and its military-industrial complex,\u201d Russian media write.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cIn Washington, talks of the fight for democracy and \u2018smart investments\u2019 cover their financial calculation\u2026 Washington does not care about Israelis and Palestinians, or Ukrainians.

If it were possible to start fighting on Mars, the United States would intervene there as well,\u201d Russian media summarize.</p> <p>On October 19, the US President delivered a special address in which he emphasized the need for further support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression and the US solidarity with Israel. The US President did indeed call assistance to Ukraine and Israel, which were attacked by terrorists, an investment for US citizens. However, the Russian media took Joe Biden\u2019s quote out of context, successfully \u201cforgetting\u201d to explain why the head of the White House used this particular expression.</p> <p>Biden was not referring to investments in \u201ckilling Ukrainians\u201d or the American military-industrial complex, as the Russian media wrote. The president was talking about investing in the security and stability of the democratic world. Biden noted that when terrorists do not pay the price for their terror, and dictators do not pay for their aggression, they cause even more chaos, death and destruction, triggering a chain of unpunished cruelty around the world.</p> <p>The American President emphasized that there is a direct link between Ukraine\u2019s victory in the Russian war and the well-being of American citizens. Biden emphasized that if we do not stop dictator Putin and his ilk now, after Ukraine and Israel, they will move on to other countries \u2013 the NATO countries, including the United States.</p> <p>\u201cSo, if we don\u2019t stop Putin\u2019s appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won\u2019t limit himself just to Ukraine.\u00a0 He\u2019s \u2014 Putin has already threated to \u201cremind\u201d \u2014 quote, \u201cremind\u201d Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia.

For 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security.\u00a0 And if Putin attacks a NATO Ally, we will defend every inch of NATO which the treaty requires and calls for. We will have something that we do not seek \u2014 make it clear: we do not seek \u2014 we do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against Russia,\u201d Biden emphasized.</p> <p>It is in this context of the possible spread of Putin\u2019s aggression to NATO countries and the prevention of direct clashes between the United States and Russia that Joe Biden said that on October 20 he was sending an urgent request to Congress to fund America\u2019s national security needs \u201cto support our critical partners Israel and Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a smart investment that\u2019s going to pay dividends for American security for generations, help us keep American troops out of harm\u2019s way, help us build a world that is safer, more peaceful, and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren,\u201d Biden emphasized.\u00a0</p> <p>In addition, the American President noted the successes of the Ukrainian army. Biden emphasized that \u201cKyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\u201d and Ukraine has already regained more than 50% of the territory occupied by Russian troops.

But in the meantime, we\u2019re gonna continue to put the Ukrainians in a position where they can defend themselves.\u201d Answering the reporter\u2019s question, President Biden simply repeated what he had already made clear at the end or March: the US will not impose any decisions on Ukraine regarding a truce with Russia, Ukraine must decide for itself whether territorial concessions are possible or impossible to achieve that truce.</p> <p>The White House also denies that President Biden is convinced that Ukraine will have to cede some of its territory tp Russia. At the June 1 briefing White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked to clarify President Biden\u2019s New York Times op-ed about Ukraine. Biden wrote that US policy is to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but did not say \u2018within its internationally recognized borders,\u2019 the journalist pointed out and asked if that was a deliberate omission intended to signal to Zelensky that Ukraine would have to give up some of its territory in its negotiations with Russia. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read into that in that way\u201d Jean-Pierre responded (18:09-18:36) and added that the US continues to support Ukraine by providing modern weapons, including HIMARS missile systems, so that Ukraine can protect its territory from Russian aggression.</p> <p>Claims that Ukraine must give away part of its territory to Russia in order to achieve a \u201ctruce\u201d is a frequent staple of Russian disinformation narratives.\u00a0 StopFake has repeatedly debunked such claims in articles such as Fake: Ukraine preparing to surrender Zaporizhzhia to Russia, Manipulation: Most Poles support the entry of troops into Ukraine to occupy Western Ukraine, Fake: Zaporizhzhia regional administration rules out returning to Kyiv control.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-says-ukraine-must-give-up-territory-to-end-war/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-says-ukraine-must-give-up-territory-to-end-war/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-says-ukraine-must-give-up-territory-to-end-war/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-says-ukraine-must-give-up-territory-to-end-war/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-says-ukraine-must-give-up-territory-to-end-war/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-biden-says-ukraine-must-give-up-territory-to-end-war/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/","title":"fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine","text":"<ul> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/#fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine","title":"Fake: Blinken Acknowledged that Russia Would \u2018Grind\u2019 Ukraine","text":"<p>2022-03-08, 10:38</p> <p></p> <p>US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that despite the large number of Russian troops, the Ukrainian Armed Forces continue to successfully repel the aggressors and expressed \u201cabsolute confidence\u201d in Ukraine\u2019s victory.</p> <p>Russian media have resorted to a classic method of creating fake news, taking the words of the American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken out of context. The Izvestia newspaper published a cursory quote from Blinken, in which he spoke about the size of the invading Russian army \u2013 the Russian propaganda machine took this as a compliment and immediately announced that Blinken felt \u201cconfident\u201d in Russia\u2019s victory over Ukraine.</p> <p>\u201cDuring a working visit to Vilnius, the head of the US State Department said that with all due respect to what the Ukrainian army is doing today, it has no chance of success\u201d writes the First Sevastopol channel web site, passing this as Blinken\u2019s opinion.</p> <p></p> <p>Screenshot Izvestiya.ru</p> <p>Russian propagandists continue to invent non-existent successes of their army and to spin those inventions into disinformation. The fake story about Secretary Blinken\u2019s \u201cconfidence\u201d in the \u201cinvincibility\u201d of the Russian army appeared after the Secretary\u2019s visit to Lithuania on March 7. Blinken\u2019s quote was taken out of context from a lengthy statement at a joint press conference with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. A Lithuanian National Television journalist asked Blinken whether a Third World War was possible in connection with Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and the civilized world.</p> <p>Asked whether NATO should be concerned that Putin would attack a member country, Blinken responded that in such an event the US would take action to defend every inch of NATO territory. Blinken also reiterated that Russia is already paying an unprecedently high price for its aggression against Ukraine. He noted the incredible effectiveness of Ukrainians in countering Russian aggression, despite the huge number of Russian troops. It was in this context that he spoke about the disproportionate number of Russian troops.</p> <p>\u201cRussia has a hugely disproportionate force compared to what Ukraine has.\u00a0 It has the ability to continue to grind down the Ukrainian military and, of course, to take horrific actions against the Ukrainian people, including attacking civilians\u2026 But as I said yesterday, even if and as Russia might win a battle in Ukraine, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s winning the war.\u00a0 If and as Russia might take a city in Ukraine, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s taking the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 It can\u2019t; it won\u2019t.\u00a0 And whether it\u2019s a week, whether it\u2019s a month, whether it\u2019s longer, I am utterly convinced that Ukraine will prevail,\u201d Blinken emphasized.</p> <p>This is not the first time that the US Secretary of State has expressed confidence in Ukraine\u2019s imminent victory in this war. A day earlier, in a March 6 interview with CNN Blinken said that Russia was doomed to failure in Ukraine: \u201c\u2026He is destined to lose.\u00a0 The Ukrainian people have demonstrated that they will not allow themselves to be subjugated to Vladimir Putin or to Russia\u2019s rule\u201d Secretary Blinken underscored.</p> <p></p> <p>\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u042e\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-blinken-acknowledged-that-russia-would-grind-ukraine/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-borrell-for-resolving-conflict-in-ukraine-militarily/","title":"fake-borrell-for-resolving-conflict-in-ukraine-militarily","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-borrell-for-resolving-conflict-in-ukraine-militarily/#fake-borrell-for-resolving-conflict-in-ukraine-militarily","title":"Fake: Borrell for Resolving Conflict in Ukraine Militarily","text":"<p>2022-04-11, 10:13</p> <p></p> <p>Josep Borrell is proposing tougher sanctions to pressure Russia to stop its war crimes in Ukraine.

It will only increase our support to Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p>Borrell believes that sanctions are the tool to pressure Russia and it is sanctions that he focuses on in the third tweet of his Twitter thread: \u201cWe need to continue to increase our pressure on Russia. We have imposed massive sanctions already but more needs to be done on the energy sector, incl oil.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Military support for Ukraine is the only way to protect the country from attacks by the Russian army and the main way of pressuring Russia towards a ceasefire is to ratchet up the sanctions in response to the Russian army\u2019s war crimes spree in Bucha and other Ukrainian towns.</p> <p>Speaking in the European Parliament in early April, Josep Borrell already noted that supplying Ukraine with weapons is helping Kyiv protect its territory and reduce human losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe want the war to end as soon as possible, but not in any way.

This \u201cadvertisement\u201d never appeared on the official website and social media pages of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.

To prove this, they publish screenshots of the advertising campaign on the @ukraine_defence page.</p> <p></p> <p>This however, is also completely false.

Facebook\u2019s Ad Library reports that this page launched an advertising campaign only once, in July 2022, for the opening of a Prague exhibition featuring Russian military equipment destroyed in Ukraine. Therefore, claims that this page advertised the \u201cBring a friend to the draft board and get 20,000 hryvnias\u201d campaign is also false.</p> <p></p> <p>The Center for Countering Disinformation at the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council also drew attention to this disinformation.

Speaking to the Liga.net online publication, Ukrainian Ground Forces command headquarters chief Roman Horbach, said that the recruitment and enlistment centers adhere to an existing plan regarding the number of specialists to be drafted in accordance with the military\u2019s needs. The \u201cbring a friend campaign\u201d therefore is completely absurd, because the Ukrainian army is drafting only those specialists that it currently needs.</p> <p>Previously, StopFake debunked Russian media manipulation claims that Defense Minister Reznikov allegedly recognized Ukraine as a \u201cWestern training ground\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-bring-a-friend-to-a-recruiting-office-and-get-20-000-hryvnia/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bring-a-friend-to-a-recruiting-office-and-get-20-000-hryvnia/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bring-a-friend-to-a-recruiting-office-and-get-20-000-hryvnia/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bring-a-friend-to-a-recruiting-office-and-get-20-000-hryvnia/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bring-a-friend-to-a-recruiting-office-and-get-20-000-hryvnia/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bring-a-friend-to-a-recruiting-office-and-get-20-000-hryvnia/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/","title":"fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/#fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees","title":"Fake: Britain Decides When to Get Rid of Ukrainian Refugees","text":"<p>2022-08-18, 09:45</p> <p></p> <p>Russian propagandist media are making false claims about British attitudes to Ukrainian refugees based on a poll conducted by the British Office of National Statistics. The Homes for Ukraine program conducted a survey to assess how long current sponsors wanted the hosting arrangement with Ukrainian refugees to last. 24% of respondents said they were ready to help with housing for more than six months, but not for longer than a year. 23% said they were ready to help for longer than a year. There was no mention of any expulsion of Ukrainians from Britain in the survey.</p> <p>Russian media are busy disseminating another fake about Ukrainian refugees, claiming that the UK has already determined when they should be \u201cexpelled\u201d from Britain. This claim is based on a survey conducted by the British Office of National Statistics.</p> <p>No one in Europe wants Ukrainian refugees, host countries are tired of Ukrainians, Ukrainian refugees are outstaying their welcome \u2013 these are some of the themes of Russia\u2019s propagandist narrative about Ukrainian refugees being actively propagated. Spreading such fakes, Russian media use emotionally loaded language, claiming countries want to \u201cexpel, drive out and get rid\u201d of Ukrainians.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>There is absolutely no language about an imminent \u201cexpulsion\u201d of Ukrainians from the UK Homes for Ukraine survey. Russian propagandists once again gleaned a small amount of data from a much larger poll and presented it as their own warped conclusion.</p> <p>The British Office of National Statistics surveyed 17,702 Britons who are registered in the Homes for Ukraine program through which British sponsors provide accommodation for Ukrainian refugees. The July 7-14 survey was conducted online, 41% of the program participants responded to the questionnaire. The overall goal of the survey was to compile a general portrait of those who are participating in the program and determine for how long they are ready to provide housing for Ukrainian refugees.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cCurrent sponsors were asked how long they wanted the existing hosting arrangements to last. There was variation in responses. Almost one in five (19%) intended to provide accommodation for six months (the minimum length of time for which sponsors were asked to offer accommodation under the scheme) \u2026. Just under one-quarter (23%) intended to provide accommodation for longer than 12 months,\u201d the survey found.</p> <p>In addition, when asked what would encourage them to host Ukrainian refugees beyond 12 months, the survey found that the majority -70% \u2013 said continued \u00a3350 monthly payments would encourage them to continue hosting for longer than 12 months.\u00a0</p> <p>Russian media also manipulatively emphasize that British participants in the program do not want to continue hosting Ukrainian refugees because of the rising cost of living, and because in addition to providing housing, they are \u201cforced\u201d to provided additional types of assistance.</p> <p>According to the survey, when asked what originally encouraged them to apply for the hosting program, a minority (10%) of all sponsors selected the \u00a3350 monthly payments as a motivation. However, \u201cthe most reported motivation for applying, by 94% of sponsors, was to help people fleeing a war zone. Around half of sponsors (51%) were motivated by having the space in their house to meet this need\u201d the survey found. Russian media, however, chose to ignore these important details.</p> <p>British agencies dealing with Ukrainian refugees say they are working on new ways of how to encourage sponsors to host Ukrainian refugees for as long as necessary.</p> <p>On July 28 the UK government announced that 100,000 Ukrainians had arrived in Britain under the Ukraine Family and Homes for Ukraine programs.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201d We understand families are having to make difficult decisions to leave their homes \u2013 which is why it is important we took the time to get this right to ensure we can continue offering safety to as many Ukrainians as possible,\u201d said UK Refugees Minister Lord Harrington.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-britain-decides-when-to-get-rid-of-ukrainian-refugees/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-britons-want-to-end-ukraine-military/","title":"fake-britons-want-to-end-ukraine-military","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-britons-want-to-end-ukraine-military/#fake-britons-want-to-end-ukraine-military-aid","title":"Fake: Britons Want to End Ukraine Military Aid","text":"<p>2022-06-30, 11:13</p> <p></p> <p>RIA Novosti has taken anonymous comments regarding a British edition Daily Mail story and presented them as the view of all of Britain. Several comments do not make a majority view, much less an official government position. Furthermore, RIA Novosti\u2019s claims completely contradict existing poll data, in which 74% of Britons support sending military aid to Ukraine.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s state-owned news agency RIA Novosti published a story claiming that the British were infuriated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s speech to the G7 summit, where he called on partners to send more weapons to Kyiv and increase Russian sanctions. RIA Novosti claims the British were displeased with Zelensky\u2019s appeal and are allegedly advocating the cessation of military assistance to Ukraine.</p> <p></p> <p>The RIA Novosti story is not about all British, but only about British Daily Mail readers who decided to comment on the publication\u2019s story about Zelensky\u2019s speech.</p> <p>RIA Novosti deliberately selected comments that criticized British military assistance to Ukraine and drew its conclusions solely on those few comments. The Daily Mail Story entitled President Zelensky says Ukraine war must end by winter as he calls on G7 leaders to supply anti-aircraft systems and even tougher Russian sanctions has 615 readers\u2019 comments, and only a few of them are critical of Zelensky\u2019s statement. Most of the comments are supportive of Ukraine, however, RIA Novosti propagandists don\u2019t bother mentioning those.</p> <p>Individual comments under one particular newspaper article certainly cannot represent the opinion of all British citizens on military aid to Ukraine. StopFake has already written about a propaganda tool for creating the illusion of public opinion support, when individual comments, most often anonymous ones, are presented as the position of the majority.</p> <p>RIA Novosti\u2019s claim that the British allegedly oppose military assistance to Ukraine in the fight against Russian aggression does not correspond with existing polling data.</p> <p>The YouGov international data and analytics research group, together with the European University Institute, conducted a survey from April 1 to 25 on the attitude of Europeans to the Russian war against Ukraine. According to their data, there is generally high support in Europe for sending humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine and helping refugees. 58% of respondents from 16 European countries, including the UK, are positive about sending weapons and military equipment to support the Ukrainian army. Moreover, 74% of UK respondents support sending military aid to Ukraine. This is one of the highest rates among European countries.</p> <p></p> <p>The recent UK in a changing Europe poll shows that more than four months after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the majority of Britons still view their government\u2019s response to military aggression in Ukraine positively.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he is confident that Western countries will \u201cnever recognize\u201d the Russian seizure of Ukrainian territories and that he will continue to exert sanctions pressure of Moscow. This particular fake is yet another example of Russian propagandists passing off the private opinion of one politician as the official position of the state. In this case they have latched onto the statement of Bundestag deputy Sahra Wagenknecht from the German Left Party (Die Linke).</p> <p></p> <p>Wagenknecht made this statement in an interview with Germany\u2019s largest news portal t-online. She believes that the war can be stopped when both sides are ready to compromise. Crimea, according to Wagenknecht, is one of those compromises.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget that Russia is a nuclear power. If you insist on the expulsion of the Russians from Crimea, then this terrible war will continue forever. The Russians have had their Black Sea Fleet in Crimea for decades, and they will not give it up. Do you want to sacrifice tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of human lives for a completely unrealistic goal?\u201d asks Wagenknecht.</p> <p>Kremlin propagandists immediately picked up the traditionally pro-Russian theses of this radical left German politician and disseminated them on RIA Novosti, REN-TV, Moskovsky Komsomolets, RT, Lenta.ru, Tsargrad, LIFE, Izvestia, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Gazeta.ru and others.</p> <p>Sahra Wagenknecht\u2019s position, however, contradicts the official position of Berlin, which supports the UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Wagenknecht\u2019s opinion also runs counter to the position of the European Union, which imposed sanctions against Russia because of its annexation of Crimea.</p> <p>The German Left Party has not made any statements supporting Wagenknecht\u2019s position on Crimea, a position that is the personal opinion of the politician.</p> <p>Wagenknecht\u2019s view on Crimea goes against international law, the interests of Ukraine, UN resolutions and the position of the EU, it does however coincide with Russian statements and interests, particularly the view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has said that \u201cthe issue of Crimea is closed.\u201d</p> <p>Deputy Wagenknecht believes that Russia\u2019s reaction to Ukraine retaking Crimea would be \u201cnuclear weapons\u201d and the \u201cBlack Sea Fleet.\u201d</p> <p>Russia\u2019s Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitri Medvedev has expressed a similar warning to Ukraine over Crimea. \u201cThey are trying to threaten us, meaning an attack on Crimea\u2026 If something like this happens, then Judgment Day will come for them all instantly. A very quick and most heavy Judgment Day. It will be very difficult to hide.\u201d Medvedev said (video, from 00:33)</p> <p>After Ukrainian strikes on the military airfield in temporarily occupied Crimea, the Russian promised doomsday did not come, and Russia lost a significant part of the naval aircraft. As for the Black Sea Fleet itself, which Bundestag deputy Wagenknecht is warning us with, the Ukrainian military have already destroyed 15 Black Sea Fleet ships, with the fleet\u2019s flagship cruiser Moskva, worth $750 million being among them. Russia has also lost control of Snake Island in the Black Sea.</p> <p>Wagenknecht asks us not to forget that \u201cRussia is a nuclear power.\u201d Russia also doesn\u2019t allow the world to forget this, with both politicians and Kremlin propagandists scaring and threatening the West with nuclear strikes.</p> <p>Russian propagandists have threatened to use nuclear weapons to destroy the \u201cenemy\u201d and turn (in the video from 00:47) \u201cthe United States into radioactive ash\u201d or drown \u201cEngland once and for all\u201d with one Sarmat missile.</p> <p>Russian Duma deputies have threatened nuclear strikes against the US, Azerbaijan and direct and immediate hits on Washington, London and Brussels. Dmitri Polyansky, the Deputy Permanent Russian Representative to the UN has said that he is sure that \u201cwe can use nuclear weapons.\u201d</p> <p>After the February 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been using nuclear terror against Ukraine by seizing nuclear power plants and accusing Ukraine\u2019s military of shelling them and provoking a nuclear catastrophe. Ukraine\u2019s Chornobyl nuclear power plant was under Russian military control from February 24 to April 1, 2022, during which time it was turned into a military base.</p> <p>Since March 4, Europe\u2019s largest atomic energy plant, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has been under the control of Russian armed forces, who have been using the plant as a military base while constantly accusing Ukraine of provocations. But Sahra Wagenknecht, of the German Left party does not mention these Russian nuclear threats.</p> <p>This German leftist politician is more concerned about Russians being \u201cexpelled from Crimea\u201d which would provoke an \u201ceternal war\u201d. At the same time, Wagenknecht says nothing about the occupying troops leaving the territory of Ukraine in order to stop this very war. Wagenknecht calls the liberation of the peninsula \u201can unrealistic goal,\u201d for which one must \u201csacrifice tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of human lives.\u201d But at the same time, she does not mention the current horrific situation with human rights in occupied Crimea and the regular shelling of the Ukrainian mainland from Crimea.</p> <p>According to the Ukrainian Constitution, \u201cThe Autonomous Republic of Crimea is an inalienable part of Ukraine\u201d (Article 134). Ukraine did not transfer this territory to Russia and has determined legislatively that \u201cThe Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have been temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation since February 20, 2014.\u201d</p> <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine would return Crimea \u201cby any means we decide. We will decide on our own, without consultions with any other state.\u201d</p> <p>The UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, adopted on March 27, 2014, confirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. The resolution does not recognize the legality of changing the status of the Crimean Autonomous Republic and the city of Sevastopol, based on the results of the \u201creferendum\u201d held on March 16, 2014. The \u201creferendum\u201d itself, according to this resolution, has no legal force.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-bundestag-recognizes-that-russia-will-not-give-up-crimea/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bundestag-recognizes-that-russia-will-not-give-up-crimea/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bundestag-recognizes-that-russia-will-not-give-up-crimea/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bundestag-recognizes-that-russia-will-not-give-up-crimea/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bundestag-recognizes-that-russia-will-not-give-up-crimea/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-bundestag-recognizes-that-russia-will-not-give-up-crimea/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-charlie-hebdo-ridicules-ukrainian-fencer-olha-kharlan/","title":"fake-charlie-hebdo-ridicules-ukrainian-fencer-olha-kharlan","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-charlie-hebdo-ridicules-ukrainian-fencer-olha-kharlan/#fake-charlie-hebdo-ridicules-ukrainian-fencer-olha-kharlan","title":"Fake: Charlie Hebdo Ridicules Ukrainian Fencer Olha Kharlan","text":"<p>2023-07-31, 10:26</p> <p></p> <p>Russia\u2019s propaganda machine periodically disseminates fake French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo magazine covers, to buttress the disinformation narrative the Kremlin in currently pushing. Whatever Russian media and its acolytes claim, there is no Charlie Hebo cover dedicated to Ukrainian Fencer Olha Kharlan.</p> <p>Russian media, and Russian social media accounts are abuzz with fakes this week, claiming that the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo satirizes the recent situation at the World Fencing Championships in Milan. Ukrainian fencer Olha Kharlan was disqualified after she refused to shake hands with her Russian opponent whom she had just beaten. Russian media claims that for this, Charlie Hebdo had ridiculed the Ukrainian champion on its latest cover.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This claim, as well as the alleged cover featured in the Russian story, is simply another Russian propaganda fake. The official Charlie Hebdo website features all of the magazine\u2019s previous covers and issues. According to the archive, there is no such cover. The President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin on the other hand, is quite often ridiculed by the magazine, but the Russian media do not pay any attention to such satire.

The disqualification decision was later rescinded, and the head of the International Olympic Committee said that Kharlan would be allowed to compete at the next Olympics.

The German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt) and the Youth Welfare Office (Jugendamt) are not aware of any such cases in the families of Ukrainian refugees.</p> <p>Kremlin media spread a claim by Volodymyr Rohov, a collaborator in the temporarily occupied part of Zaporizhzhia region, that Ukrainian children were \u201cbrazenly taken away\u201d from their refugee parents in Europe.\u00a0</p> <p>According to Rohov, \u201cbabies are taken from their families for odd reasons \u2013 such as excessive appetite and strong emotional attachment to parents\u201d. He said that there are already 79 such known cases, and that most often such cases occur in Germany.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Russian media regularly propagate the narrative that in European countries, children, especially refugees, are taken away from their families for any reason. In this way, Russian propaganda tries to create an image of an unsafe Europe that lacks traditional family values (in the Russian definition of the term), where children are torn from their parents in order to instil in them the European values that are so deeply alien to Russians. The version that children are then allegedly handed over to pedophiles, or even sold to organ traffickers, is also spreading.</p> <p>StopFake has contacted various child protective services in Germany and hasn\u2019t received any confirmation that such cases have occurred. Responding to StopFake the German Criminal Police press service noted that it is unaware of any such cases. A review of various European media also shows that no one has written about such cases, although journalists would clearly pay attention to such stories, especially if there are 79 of them, as Russian propagandist Rohov claims.\u00a0</p> <p>Due to the fact that fakes about taking children away from refugee families in Germany are common, European journalists from InfoMigrants released a short explanatory video that debunks this claim. For example, InfoMigrants explains that Germany has the Jugendamt, the Youth Welfare Office, and its role is to support parents in childcare and upbringing, as well as to help during difficult times, such as divorce.</p> <p>\u201cBut the Jugendamt does not check upon your parenting as part of any integration or asylum process. It has no opinion about your parenting style or your cultural customs. However: It may get involved if there is any indication that you might be harming or hurting your child. It will interfere if there is proof that you are posing a threat to your child\u2019s wellbeing. Such threats include: Physical, sexual or psychological abuse. As long as you raise your child with love and respect and don\u2019t hurt your son or daughter, you have nothing to fear\u201d the InfoMigrants explain.\u00a0</p> <p>German officials that do have the authority to remove children from their families state that this extreme measure is used only if the child is in serious danger. In other cases experts decide together with the parents what kind of temporary assistance can be provided to the child. If a child\u2019s stay in the family is dangerous for him or her, then the child is placed either with a foster family or in special institutions, such as special children\u2019s hostels. It should be noted that if a child is nevertheless taken from his or her home, such offices actively work to ensure that the child maintains contact with his or her biological family. But then again, no one has ever been taken away from their parents for having a \u201cbad appetite\u201d or \u201cstrong emotional attachment\u201d.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that the only source of this disinformation is the collaborator Volodymyr Rohov, who has repeatedly spread fakes and propaganda narratives of the Kremlin.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-children-are-taken-away-from-ukrainian-refugees-in-germany-for-having-emotion-and-appetite/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-children-are-taken-away-from-ukrainian-refugees-in-germany-for-having-emotion-and-appetite/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-children-are-taken-away-from-ukrainian-refugees-in-germany-for-having-emotion-and-appetite/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-children-are-taken-away-from-ukrainian-refugees-in-germany-for-having-emotion-and-appetite/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-children-are-taken-away-from-ukrainian-refugees-in-germany-for-having-emotion-and-appetite/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-children-are-taken-away-from-ukrainian-refugees-in-germany-for-having-emotion-and-appetite/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/","title":"fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/#fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs","title":"Fake: Cholera in Lower Reaches of Dnipro Caused by US Biolabs","text":"<p>2023-06-22, 16:24</p> <p></p> <p>Ukrainian Ministry of Health assesses water quality in the reservoirs of Kherson, Odesa, and Mykolaiv regions on a daily basis, and the epidemic situation is currently under control, with no outbreaks of infectious diseases in the affected areas. The narrative about the US biolabs is not confirmed either by specialized experts from different countries or by international organizations working to reduce the threat of proliferation of mass destruction weapons.</p> <p>Russian propaganda spreads another batch of conspiracy theories that the alleged emergence of cholera pathogens may be linked to U.S. biolabs. This statement was made by State Duma Deputy Speaker Irina Yarova.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>\u201cDuring the investigation, we clearly confirmed the Pentagon\u2019s preoccupation with cholera and tularemia, and its focus on covert and deliberate exposure in areas where outbreaks supposedly occur naturally. The laboratory in Odesa was set up by the United States with gross violations of safety requirements. This is confirmed by witness testimony. Anything can be expected from it it in the worst security context,\u201d Yarovaya said.</p> <p>The narrative about US biolabs is one of the most frequently repeated narratives in Russian propaganda. It is also one of the Russian explanations for the criminal war against Ukraine. There are no U.S. biological weapons laboratories on the territory of Ukraine. On the contrary, in 2005, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the U.S. Department of Defense signed an agreement on cooperation in preventing the spread of technologies, pathogens, and knowledge that could be used in the development of biological weapons. Russia had a similar cooperation program in place, but it was suspended in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea.</p> <p>It was Russia that jeopardized the health of the Ukrainian population by committing a terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, the destruction of which became a real environmental disaster that will have severe humanitarian and economic consequences for the country. The destruction of the hydroelectric power plant in many towns and villages has significantly hampered access to drinking water, leaving about 700,000 people without it. Open water intake has been restricted, as all the water downstream of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant has been poisoned due to the destruction of \u0441emeteries, agricultural chemical storage facilities, etc.</p> <p>Ukrainian Ministry of Health calls to refrain from the consumption and use of untreated water from the Dnipro River and other water bodies in the territories of Kherson, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro and Odesa regions affected by the terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP. Cholera and botulism can indeed occur due to limited access to clean water, so certain safety rules should be followed, as emphasized by the agency: use only bottled or imported water, wash hands with soap, use only purified water for cooking and household needs, etc.</p> <p>Today, about 30% of water samples taken from surface water bodies and recreation areas do not meet hygiene standards (185 out of 579 samples do not meet standards). The highest level of danger is currently observed in Odesa region, where the most significant and constant exceedances of sanitary-chemical, microbiological and toxicological indicators have been recorded. The Ministry of Health reported that approximately 97 rapid response teams have been formed in the affected regions to respond to possible biological, chemical and radiation threats.</p> <p>On June 13, the ministry noted that no cases or suspicions of cholera had been registered in Ukraine. The country is also checking the work of laboratories that must act quickly in the event of the spread of intestinal infections; WHO and international partners have provided Ukraine with cholera diagnostic and treatment kits.</p> <p>Earlier, StopFake debunks fakes that the United States had confirmed the operation of \u201csecret biolabs\u201d in Ukraine and that a \u201cNATO biolab\u201d had been discovered in Mariupol.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-cholera-in-lower-reaches-of-dnipro-caused-by-us-biolabs/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/","title":"fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/#fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets","title":"Fake: Corruption up by 500% in Ukraine Over Past Year, US Aid Not Reaching Targets","text":"<p>2023-04-21, 13:56</p> <p></p> <p>This claim about corruption levels in Ukraine is false.

But sooner or later, everyone\u2019s patience runs out, even in the seemingly generous American trough \u2013 particularly when your own marionettes are sucking up the money\u201d \u2013 Russian propaganda Telegram channels write.</p> <p></p> <p>In fact, this claim is not true and is completely unfounded, Congressman Michael McCall\u2019s statements were misinterpreted, and others were completely made up.</p> <p>The source of this disinformation was a March 29 Congressional hearing about mechanisms guaranteeing transparency and accountability of US assistance to Ukraine. In his opening remarks, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. McCall stated that \u201conly 20 percent of the funding goes directly to the Ukrainian government in the form of direct budgetary assistance.\u201d It was this sentence that was purposefully distorted by some pro-Russian Telegram channels, which declared that only 20% of financial assistance to Ukraine actually reaches the recipient, and the rest is allegedly stolen by the Ukrainian authorities.</p> <p>What Congressman McCall\u2019s actually said is as follows: \u201cOf the 113 billion dollars appropriated across four supplementals, approximately 60 percent is going to American troops, American workers, and to modernizing American stockpiles. In fact, only 20 percent of the funding is going directly to the Ukrainian government in the form of direct budgetary assistance.\u201d</p> <p>The US aid package includes direct assistance to Ukraine \u2013 economic, military and budgetary assistance to the Ukrainian government; humanitarian aid in Ukraine and countries hosting Ukrainian refugees; and US spending to support global democracy in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s unprovoked attack on Ukraine. These expenditures include compensation to the US Army for the weapons it transfers to Ukraine; support for US troops stationed in Europe; funds for Ukrainian refugees in the United States; funds for nuclear incident fallout management preparation. More details about the different categories of funding are discussed here.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t just this statement by McCall that Russian media manipulated and distorted. The allegation that the United States is allegedly recording \u201chuge numbers of corruption and theft\u201d in Ukraine, and that corruption has grown by 500% over the past year, was completely made up and directly contradicts the committee\u2019s conclusions.</p> <p>During the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, inspectors general from the US State and Defense Departments and US Agency for International Development (USAID) were questioned about transparency and accountability mechanisms for US assistance to Ukraine, and they unanimously stated that \u201cthere is no evidence that support for Ukraine was misused.\u201d</p> <p>Answering a question posed by Republican Congressman Scott Perry from Pennsylvania, whether the government can guarantee that the money sent to Ukraine is not lost, misused or misspent, US Defense Department Inspector General Robert Storch replied \u201cWhat I\u2019ve testified to, congressman, is that based on our completed work, we have not substantiated any instances of diversion of U.S. security.\u201d</p> <p>In his opening remarks, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCall stressed that oversight is not about calling the importance of support for Ukraine into question, but about ensuring that aid is \u201cused for its intended purpose.\u201d</p> <p>During a March 29 briefing National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby echoed what the three inspectors general testified \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there\u2019s been any egregious misconduct when it comes to managing the security assistance that\u2019s gone into Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p>There are no statements by American officials that corruption in Ukraine has increased by 500% over the past year. This information was invented by Russian propagandists. Such an outrageously high growth of corruption in Ukraine during a year of war has not been recorded by any international organizations. According to Transparency International, Ukraine received 33 points in the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2022, which is the highest score it has received since the launch of the updated Corruption Perceptions Index methodology.</p> <p>Kremlin propaganda outlets regularly spread disinformation about Ukraine to undermine trust between the country\u2019s allies. StopFake has debunked similar disinformation, such as the fake claim that Ukrainian President\u00a0 Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cappropriated 400 million dollars allocated by the United States.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-corruption-up-by-500-in-ukraine-over-past-year-us-aid-not-reaching-targets/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-counteroffensive-dead-and-wounded-information-published-in-ukraine/","title":"fake-counteroffensive-dead-and-wounded-information-published-in-ukraine","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-counteroffensive-dead-and-wounded-information-published-in-ukraine/#fake-counteroffensive-dead-and-wounded-information-published-in-ukraine","title":"Fake: Counteroffensive Dead and Wounded Information Published in Ukraine","text":"<p>2023-07-06, 10:07</p> <p></p> <p>Russian propagandists have created a fake site to spread false information about Ukrainian counteroffensive losses. There are no public forums or organizations that track counteroffensive casualty numbers. This information is confidential. Ukrainian military and their allies note that Ukrainian Armed Forces losses are much smaller than those incurred by the Russian army.</p> <p>Russian Telegram channels, as well as social media users, are claiming that a Ukrainian website has published the number of \u201ccounteroffensive victims\u201d. They claim that nearly 88,000 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed and wounded since Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive began in June.</p> <p></p> <p>StopFake journalists analyzed the circulating screenshot from this alleged \u201cUkrainian site\u201d propagating this information and found considerable evidence suggesting the site was created by Russian propagandists.</p> <p>First, popular search engines do not turn up such a site \u2013 https://www.stayingalive.in.ua/. There is also no information about the site domain on the who.is and whoxy domain search engines. At the same time, the site\u2019s cache is stored in the Yandex Russian search engine cache. Second, the site description, which appears only in Yandex, repeats Russian propaganda narratives: \u201cIt is important to remember that the counteroffensive victims are increasing due to the actions of the criminal authorities and unprofessional command. And they have names.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>This new suspicious site has a link to an email, where one can write supposedly to search for those missing in action. StopFake verified this email address using various tools. Although the address does indeed exist \u2013 it does not link to any social media accounts and there is no information that whoever or whatever is behind this email address is actually searching for missing servicemen.</p> <p>The very name of the site \u2013 stayingalive.in.ua \u2013 parodies the name of the real charity fund \u201cCome back alive\u201d \u2013 savelife.in.ua, which helps Ukraine\u2019s military by providing them with night vision goggles, drones, cars, surveillance systems and much more, items that help to save soldiers\u2019 lives. This organization does not search for the missing and does not keep track of casualties.</p> <p>In May 2023, Ukraine launched the Unified Register of Missing Persons, which also includes data on servicemen missing in action. Radio Liberty has prepared an instruction manual for relatives of servicemen who are missing and are unreachable. Among the organizations which look for missing military personnel, there is also no such site as stayingalive.in.ua.</p> <p>Information on the number of dead and wounded Ukrainian servicemen is not published and remains confidential. In an interview for the Spanish El Mundo publication, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted\u00a0 that it is impossible to give an exact number of casualties and wounded, but the Russian Federation incurs much greater losses among the military than Ukraine does. Ukraine\u2019s Defense Minister\u00a0 Oleksiy Reznikov, in an interview with RFE/RL Current Time program, confirmed Zelensky\u2019s words \u2013 that the losses on the Ukrainian side are much lesser than those of the Russians. \u201cThis is war. There are losses. But precisely because we do not use the tactics of a meat grinder, the losses on the Ukrainian side are much smaller than on the Russian side,\u201d Reznikov said.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Defense Minister Anna Malyar also spoke about Ukrainian military casualties incurred in the south of the country, where the counteroffensive is unfolding.

In temporarily occupied Crimea, Russian security forces continue pursuing a policy of repression against the Crimean Tatars, massively imprisoning them for supporting Ukraine.</p> <p>Russia continues to push its narratives about the Crimean Tataras\u2019 mythical support for Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. On April 30, pro-Kremlin media reported that Crimean Tatars had declared their \u201cfull support for Russia\u2019s foreign policy\u201d and \u201cunanimously\u201d supported Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Russian media also claimed that Crimean Tatars are ready to participate in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, a war that Moscow continues to call a \u201cspecial operation\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>On April 30 Russian authorities of occupied Crimea held a show congress during which Crimean Tatars allegedly declared their support for Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. According to Refat Chubarov, the chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, to create their fake picture of mass support, the Russian authorities forced students from the Crimean Engineering and Pedagogical University, as well as state employees and teachers to attend the meeting. Chubarov emphasized that the meeting has no political weight and does not reflect the real pro-Ukrainian position of the of Ukraine\u2019s indigenous Crimean Tatars.</p> <p>\u201cThe only purpose for which Russia\u2019s FSB is organizing this \u201ccongress\u201d is to simulate Crimean Tatar support for \u201cPutin\u2019s policy and his special military operation\u201d against Ukraine. The \u201ccongress\u201d that Russian special services are holding will once again, but absolutely unsuccessfully, try to deceive the world that Crimean Tatars are demonstrating loyalty to the occupying country\u2019s policy and its president, Putin,\u201d Chubarov wrote on his Facebook page.</p> <p>Since the capture of Crimea, Russia has been manipulating the topic of the Crimean Tatar people. On the one hand Moscow is creating an illusion of \u201cmultinational unity in Russia, but on the other, it is pursuing a relentless policy of repression against the Crimean Tatars who are arrested on a mass scale for supporting Ukraine. According to the Crimean human rights organization CrimeaSOS, as of April 2022, 144 people are subjected to politically motivated criminal prosecutions, 122 are already in prison. Imprisoned Crimean Tatars are charged with extremism and terrorism. Russian security services use these charges to round up pro-Ukrainian Crimeans who disagree with the Russian occupation and annexation of Crimea and Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.</p> <p>After invading Ukraine and seizing new territories in southern Ukraine, Russian security forces are continuing their policy of violating the rights and freedoms of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars. The Russian invaders are persecuting Crimean Tatars in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces, illegally detaining, kidnapping, and torturing them.</p> <p>According to Ludmila Denysova, Ukraine\u2019s Parliamentary Ombudsman for Human Rights, Ukraine has applied to the United Nations Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Violations in order that international experts take note and account of Russia\u2019s violation of the rights of Crimean Tatars as well as other crimes Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people.</p> <p>It is also against the law to mobilize Ukrainian citizens living in temporarily occupied territories into the Russian invading army. Conscription for military service in Russian armed forces is a violation of not only Ukrainian but also international law. The recruitment of conscripts in occupied Crimea is prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention (articles 51 and 147) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (article 8 (2)(a)(v)). Crimeans forcibly drafted into the ranks of Russia\u2019s occupying army are victims of the armed conflict and not criminals. They cannot and will not be prosecuted by Ukrainian authorities, the Crimea Prosecutor\u2019s office reported. Ukraine has prepared detailed instructions on how Ukrainian citizens from occupied Crimea who have been illegally mobilized into the Russian army can surrender, save their lives and not follow criminal orders.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-crimean-tatars-unanimously-support-russia-s-special-operation-in-ukraine/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-crimean-tatars-unanimously-support-russia-s-special-operation-in-ukraine/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-crimean-tatars-unanimously-support-russia-s-special-operation-in-ukraine/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-crimean-tatars-unanimously-support-russia-s-special-operation-in-ukraine/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-crimean-tatars-unanimously-support-russia-s-special-operation-in-ukraine/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-crimean-tatars-unanimously-support-russia-s-special-operation-in-ukraine/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-czech-republic-s-reminds-ukraine-of-possible-territorial-claims/","title":"fake-czech-republic-s-reminds-ukraine-of-possible-territorial-claims","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-czech-republic-s-reminds-ukraine-of-possible-territorial-claims/#fake-czech-republics-reminds-ukraine-of-possible-territorial-claims","title":"Fake: Czech Republic\u2019s Reminds Ukraine of Possible Territorial Claims","text":"<p>2022-03-22, 15:10</p> <p></p> <p>Czech political analyst and author Oskar Krej\u010d\u00ed is known for his pro-Russian views and does not represent the official position of the Czech Republic.

Krej\u010d\u00ed said the following about the visit:</p> <p>\u201cThis is a gesture, and it belongs to the politics of gestures. This visit could help stop the hostilities only if, after talks with Kyiv, the Prime Ministers begin talks with Moscow. Then this gesture would become a contribution to the cause of peace.

And Kyiv should not forget that in addition to questions concerning Ukraine\u2019s eastern border, someone could raise questions about the western border.\u201d</p> <p>Krej\u010d\u00ed goes on to say that nothing can prevent the defeat of the Ukrainian army, that the Russian army is moving slowly because it is \u201ctrying to prevent great losses of its soldiers and civilians\u201d and dutifully repeats other Russian propaganda tropes.</p> <p>Krej\u010d\u00ed\u2019s pronouncements, which closely mirror Kremlin narratives, are regularly featured in the Russian media. Oskar Krej\u010d\u00ed predictably calls the Euromaida revolution a \u201ccoupd\u2019etat\u201d, posits that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Rebublics cannot be called \u201ccompletely illegitimate\u201d and declares that Russia always wins wars. Prior to Russia unleashing its invasion on Ukraine, Krej\u010d\u00ed said he was warier of Kyiv attacking the Russian controlled separatist statelets in eastern Ukraine than Russia attacking Ukraine.</p> <p>A Communist Party member since the late 1960s, from 1975 until the end communist rule in Czecho-Slovakia Krej\u010d\u00ed was an agent of the country\u2019s St\u00e1tn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnost (StB) intelligence and counter-intelligence agency, which persecuted any activity that was considered opposition to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the state.</p> <p>The Czech Republic has never questioned Ukraine\u2019s western borders or made any claims to any Ukrainian territory.

Russian media used this fake to reinforce the narrative that Ukraine is allegedly to blame for Dugina\u2019s death, and then themselves denied that Vovk was in fact killed.</p> <p>Social media, various Telegram channels, as well as pro-Kremlin media disseminated fakes claiming that that Natalya Vovk, whom Russia accused of murdering Russian propagandist Daria Dugina, was allegedly killed in Austria. \u201cThe woman was found with 17 stab wounds and a note in her hand,\u201dthe propagandists wrote.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The first publication to write about Natalya Vovk being \u201cmurdered\u201d was the Austrian Exxpress. The site presents itself as an \u201celite tabloid\u201d, although media experts consider this publication to violate journalistic standards. In the story about Vovk\u2019s alleged murder, the headline itself already contains an element of manipulation, stating that Vovk is only \u201cprobably dead\u201d: \u201c17 stab wounds: the murderer in the case of Daria Dugina is probably dead.\u201d The story lacks facts \u2014\u00a0 its only sources are anonymous Telegram channels. To illustrate the story the author used a National Guard identification card \u2014 but with a photo of Margarita Simonyan, the main Russian propagandist from Russia Today. This \u201cdocument\u201d is actually a popular parody meme that was circulated in response to the Russian Federal Security Service\u2019s \u201cirrefutable\u201d evidence that Ukrainians were involved in Dugina\u2019s murder, which quickly appeared online.</p> <p></p> <p>Remarkably, both Telegram channels and social media, who were the first to spread information about Natalya Vovk\u2019s alleged murder, made it clear to readers that \u201cUkrainian special services are covering their tracks\u201d and that perhaps such news will help \u201chide Vovk somewhere in Europe\u201d. But soon after the Austrian tabloid\u2019s article was published, Russian media quickly debunked their own fake and massively spread its refutation. In particular, Russian journalists noted that the tabloid used an old photo in this news, which was first published by Russian REN TV back in July 2020. The photograph used to illustrate Vovk\u2019s \u201cmurder\u201d showed a 26-year-old woman killed by her fianc\u00e9 in Moscow. And later, Russian publications also disseminated the refutation of this entire story by the Austrian Internal Affairs Ministry,\u00a0 as reported by RIA Novosti.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It is also worth noting that spreading fakes and disinformation through anonymous Telegram channels that are then picked up by traditional media is a common Russian propaganda method.</p> <p>Russian media used this fake to strengthen their version about Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the murder of Dugin\u2019s daughter. To that end, the Komsomolskaya Pravda website, cites a Russian \u201cexpert\u201d who stated that \u201cit would be ideal for Kyiv if the perpetrator of Daria Dugina\u2019s murder simply disappeared. She is no longer needed and is even dangerous. This is a traditional tactic of terrorist groups that eliminate killers. She should surrender to the Russian authorities. It at least would save her life\u201d. The same statement is repeated by another \u201cpolitical scientist\u201d on the Vzglyad website: \u201cOne way or another, I assume that Natalya Vovk\u2019s death is inevitable. Most likely, she is no longer valuable to the Ukrainian special services, so it would be quite logical if they want to get rid of her\u201d.</p> <p>Daria Dugina died on August 20 when the car she was driving exploded. At first, Russia blamed Ukraine for what happened, although Ukrainian authorities announced that Ukraine had nothing to do with these events and that Ukraine, unlike Russia, was not a terrorist state. The version of the Russian Federal Security Service has many inconsistencies, such as, the \u201cproof\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s \u201cguilt\u201d consisting of entirely of forged documents.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-daria-dugina-murderer-found-dead-in-austria/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-daria-dugina-murderer-found-dead-in-austria/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-daria-dugina-murderer-found-dead-in-austria/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-daria-dugina-murderer-found-dead-in-austria/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-daria-dugina-murderer-found-dead-in-austria/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-daria-dugina-murderer-found-dead-in-austria/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-document-says-that-ukrainian-general-requests-additional-burial-plots-at-the-zaporizhia-cemetery-for-polish-mercenaries/","title":"fake-document-says-that-ukrainian-general-requests-additional-burial-plots-at-the-zaporizhia-cemetery-for-polish-mercenaries","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-document-says-that-ukrainian-general-requests-additional-burial-plots-at-the-zaporizhia-cemetery-for-polish-mercenaries/#fake-document-says-that-ukrainian-general-requests-additional-burial-plots-at-the-zaporizhia-cemetery-for-polish-mercenaries","title":"Fake: Document Says that Ukrainian General Requests Additional Burial Plots at the Zaporizhia Cemetery for \u201cPolish Mercenaries\u201d","text":"<p>2023-05-25, 19:49</p> <p></p> <p>This \u201cletter\u201d has been forged, as evidenced by numerous gross errors in the text and vocabulary not typical of official documents.

The recipient of this letter is indicated as \u201cHead of the City Administration of Zaporizhia Kurtiv A.V.\u201d</p> <p>The presence of numerous mistakes and inaccuracies in the text of the \u201cdocument\u201d indicates that it is nothing more than a forgery.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the fact that in this \u201cdocument,\u201d not only the recipient\u2019s surname is misspelled, but also the position is incorrectly indicated. The fact is that currently Zaporizhia does not have a mayor and the duties of the city mayor are performed by the secretary of the Zaporizhia City Council until new elections take place. In 2021, the previously elected mayor, Volodymyr Buryak, submitted a resignation letter due to health reasons, and since then, his duties have been carried out by the secretary of the Zaporizhia City Council, Anatoliy Kurtiev. In the fake \u201cdocument\u201d, the recipient is mentioned as \u201chead of the administration of the city of Zaporizhia Kurtiv A.V.\u201d Most likely, it refers to Anatoliy Kurtiev, the secretary of the city council. Although Anatoliy Kurtiev temporarily performs the duties of the mayor, he is not the \u201chead of the city administration.\u201d In all official documents, he is referred to as the \u201csecretary of the city council.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>The letter also contains many factual errors. For example, Major General Oleh Mikats allegedly addressed the city administration requesting additional burial plots for \u201cPolish volunteers\u201d at the old cemetery of German prisoners of war in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Zaporizhia Oblast. However, there is no Shevchenkivskyi district in Zaporizhia Oblast. Most likely, it refers to the Shevchenkivskyi district of Zaporizhia city, where the cemetery for the victims of World War II is actually located. Furthermore, the text mentions that the Polish volunteers supposedly serve in units of the Operational Command South, although the author of this \u201cletter\u201d is the command of a completely different military-land zone \u2013 the East.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition, the text contains vocabulary that is not typical of official documents, such as \u201ccounteroffensive\u201d and \u201coccupied Donbas.\u201d We remind you that in Ukraine, there is a legislatively established correct name for these territories, which is \u201ctemporarily occupied territories in Donetsk and Luhansk regions\u201d (and since August 2022, the term \u201ctemporarily occupied territory of Ukraine by the Russian Federation\u201d has been introduced).

The latest publication with the economist on the company\u2019s YouTube page dates back to January 14, 2018.</p> <p>Shortly after the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Kiyosaki expressed support for Ukraine, stating that if he were in Ukraine, he would also fight for freedom. Regarding the impact of the war on the economy, Kiyosaki emphasizes that it will push the development of cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Authors</p> <ul> <li> <p></p> <p>VoxCheck Team</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-economist-robert-kiyosaki-called-any-financial-inflows-into-ukraine-senseless-bloomberg/#attention","title":"Attention","text":"<p>The authors do not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have no relevant affiliations</p> <ul> <li>Tags:</li> <li>#VoxCheck</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-economist-robert-kiyosaki-called-any-financial-inflows-into-ukraine-senseless-bloomberg/#read-on-topic","title":"Read on topic:","text":"<ul> <li>Society</li> <li>VoxCheck</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-economist-robert-kiyosaki-called-any-financial-inflows-into-ukraine-senseless-bloomberg/#public-health-fakes-dengue-fever-spreading-in-ukraine-issue-134","title":"Public Health Fakes: Dengue Fever Spreading in Ukraine.

At the same time, the Russian media omitted a large part of the European diplomat\u2019s speech that followed this phrase: Borrell did not express any doubts about the prospect of the war ending in Ukraine\u2019s favor and did not recognize Russia\u2019s victory over the Ukrainian defense forces. The head of European diplomacy was talking about the importance of further support for Ukraine.</p> <p>\u201cThe greatest security guarantee we can give Ukraine is to make it a member of the European family. But for that, we must remain united and prepare for a longer conflict than Russia thought and which Russia can never win, but whose end it can delay. Because Putin\u2019s regime has become addicted to war, it needs war\u2026 He believes that democracies are weak and will falter and we cannot prove him right. We have to continue to support Ukraine,\u201d Borrell emphasized.</p> <p>The head of European diplomacy noted that the full-scale war in Ukraine has been going on for more than a year and a half \u2013 much longer than Russia expected, which planned to seize the country in two weeks and establish its own puppet regime, similar to the Belarusian one. Borrell emphasized that, contrary to dictator Putin\u2019s expectations, Ukraine has not only not fallen, but is regaining its territories. This was made possible by Ukraine\u2019s fierce resistance to the Kremlin regime and the support of its allies, Borrell said. Thus, the EU High Representative emphasized, Ukraine is the EU\u2019s top priority and the work to support the country should continue until it wins the Russian war.\u00a0</p> <p>StopFake has repeatedly refuted Russian fakes about the Ukrainian Armed Forces\u2019 resistance to Russian aggression.

The following violations may be reasons for deportation: unpaid fines, expired visas, invalid invitation, criminal record not indicated on visa application, public order violations, illegal stay in a country.</p> <p>None of these require the deportation of Ukrainian men for mobilization in Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces.</p> <p>Protocol 7, Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights states: \u201cAn alien lawfully resident in the territory of a State shall not be expelled therefrom except in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with law.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p></p> <p>The UN High Commissioner for Refugees report states that since the beginning of the Russian invasion, almost a third of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes. \u201cThis is the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. 7.1 million people have been displaced by the war in Ukraine and 15.7 million are estimated to urgently require humanitarian assistance and protection\u201d says the UN.</p> <p></p> <p>According to UNHCR data, as of June 17, 2022, 7,567,024 Ukrainian citizens have crossed EU borders. 3,407,378 of those have applied for temporary protection and according to EU law, they are prohibited from being expelled from the countries where they have sought refuge.</p> <p>According to Article 9(1) of the Directive on Common Procedures for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection (2013/32/EU), the presence of an asylum-seeker in the territory of an EU Member State is lawful.</p> <p>The UN Refugee Convention from July 28, 1951, lists a number of reasons prohibiting the expulsion of refugees to the country from which they arrived.</p> <p>In particular Article 33 of the convention prohibits the expulsion or return of refugees to countries \u201cwhere his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Russia\u2019s military actions on the territory of Ukraine are not only a direct threat to life but are also recognized by some countries as genocide. Among such countries are Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic and others.</p> <p>To deport all men to Ukraine, according to collaborator Kirill Stremousov, the European Union must resort to a number of violations:</p> <ul> <li>change or violate the European Convention on Human Rights and expel from the EU those, who are there legally</li> <li>violate the UN Convention on the Rights of Refugees and force people to return to places where their lives are in danger</li> <li>Ignore the fact that some countries recognize Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine as genocide.</li> </ul> <p>If, as Stremousov claims, the European Union is now considering such a possibility, then there must be some evidence of this, for example, in the form of an official request from the Ukrainian side or an official statement from the EU about the possibility of such a decision.

This narrative is another Russian disinformation.</p> <p>Russian media outlets report that Europe has allegedly \u201cdecided to get rid of Ukrainian refugees, and therefore the record of Ukrainians of military age may result in mobilization to the Armed Forces.\u201d</p> <p>A similar disinformation narrative has been repeatedly spread by Kremlin resources, in particular to point out the lack of mobilization resources in Ukraine. StopFake refuted a similar narrative in the article \u201cFake: EU May Deport Ukrainians for Military Mobilization in Ukraine\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>In support of this fake, Russian Telegram channels wrote that the Austrian and German Interior Ministries allegedly started counting refugees of military age from Ukraine.</p> <p>In fact, such statements have no legal basis. Ukrainian diplomatic missions cannot deport Ukrainians for mobilization to the Armed Forces, nor are EU institutions authorized to form any units from Ukrainians on their territories.</p> <p>The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine can only return to Ukraine men who are liable for military service and who illegally try to cross the border during martial law, and those who have no grounds for refugee status. This was explained by Andriy Demchenko, a spokesperson of the State Border Guard Service.</p> <p>Currently, Ukrainians liable for military service who have traveled abroad for more than three months must register for military service at Ukrainian diplomatic missions abroad. This includes all IDPs who have been living abroad since the beginning of the full-scale war. At the same time, foreign missions are not authorized to issue military draft notices to Ukrainians. Also, diplomatic missions do not have the authority to deport men who are liable for military service to Ukraine.</p> <p>\u201cMilitary registration in foreign diplomatic missions is more of a declarative mechanism for finding out the data of Ukrainian citizens. Ignoring this rule is not a ground for deportation. Diplomatic missions have no legal grounds for this,\u201d military lawyer Yaroslav Zhukrovsky said in a commentary to Hromadske.\u00a0</p> <p>The European Union also assured that they will not deport anyone against their will, and have no intention of restricting the entry of men from Ukraine. For Europe, all Ukrainians who arrived in the region after the start of the full-scale invasion fall under the protection of the Temporary Protection Directive. Only the following violations can serve as grounds for deportation: unpaid fines, overstayed visa, invalid invitation, criminal record not indicated at the time of visa issuance, violation of public order, or illegal stay in the country.</p> <p>As for refugee registration, at the end of June 2023, Eurostat counted the number of Ukrainians who received temporary protection in the EU. The data was collected to understand the overall picture, but not to count Ukrainians of military age.</p> <p>\u201cOn 30 June 2023, almost 4.07 million non-EU citizens, who fled Ukraine as a consequence of the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022, had temporary protection status in EU countries. The main EU countries hosting beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine were Germany (1 133 420 people; 28% of the total), Poland (977 740; 24%) and Czechia (349 140; 9%),\u201d Eurostat reports.

His views are his own and do not reflect the position of the European Parliament and the European Union. The EU continues to provide assistance to Ukraine, through grants that do not need to be repaid and loans provided on very favorable terms.</p> <p>Pro-Kremlin media once again resorted to a tried and true disinformation tactic, taking the opinion of one marginal politician and passing it off as the view of the European Parliament, this time sowing doubt as to Ukraine\u2019s capacity to pay off its debts.</p> <p>France is afraid Ukraine won\u2019t settle its debts with the West, declared the URA.ru news agency. European Parliament doubts Ukraine can pay off its foreign loans, RT in Russian headlines.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This is not the first time that French MEP Thierry Mariani has become a source of disinformation which was then actively disseminated by Russian media. StopFake has debunked fake stories that originate with Thierry, such as the claim that the French parliament was lifting sanctions against the Russian Federation. Here again, Thierry was the initiator of this resolution, which went nowhere. Mariani has visited Russian annexed and occupied Crimea, a visit that Russian media presented as an official EU visit, when in fact it was a private visit by pro-Russian individuals with close ties to the Kremlin.</p> <p>Not only do Mariani\u2019s pronouncements not correspond with reality, but they are also not the official position of the European Parliament. Since the beginning of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the EU has raised about 4.1 billion euros for Ukraine\u2019s overall economic, social and financial resilience in the form of emergency macro-financial assistance, budget support, emergency assistance, crisis response and humanitarian aid.</p> <p>In addition, from March to May 2022, Ukraine was allocated 1.2 billion euros for macro-financial assistance. Grant assistance in the amount of a 120-million-euro grant was allocated to support state governance.</p> <p>Also in May, the European Commission offered to provide Ukraine with additional macro-financial assistance in the form of loans of up to 9 billion euros. According to Bloomberg, \u201cthe new macro-financial assistance program for Kyiv will consist of 25-year loans with a 10-year grace period to reimburse the principal, three EU officials said, adding that interest payments will be covered from the EU budget.\u201d</p> <p>As explained in a European Commission press release: \u201cUnder the proposal, MFA funds will be made available to Ukraine in the form of long-term loans on favourable terms. The assistance will support Ukraine\u2019s macroeconomic stability and overall resilience in the context of Russia\u2019s military aggression and the ensuing economic challenges. In a further expression of solidarity, the EU budget will cover the interest costs on this loan. As for all previous MFA loans, the Commission will borrow funds on international capital markets and transfer the proceeds on the same terms to Ukraine. This loan to Ukraine will be backed for 70% of the value by amounts set aside from the EU budget.\u201c</p> <p></p> <p>On July 7, the European Parliament accepted the European Commission\u2019s proposal to disburse the first 1 billion euros of the first tranche of this assistance. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the first part of the assistance plan \u201cwill enable us to provide an immediate response to Ukraine\u2019s urgent needs.\u201d</p> <p>The European Union has also begun work on the legal justification for the possible use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine\u2019s rebuilding.</p> <p>Back in May of this year, the US Congress also passed a bill seeking the \u201cimmediate bilateral, multilateral, and commercial debt service relief for Ukraine\u201d. The idea of temporarily suspending payments on Ukraine\u2019s international debts is actively being promoted. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the Ukrainian economy has taken a huge hit and contracted by over 40%. In a recent interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais, Ukraine\u2019s Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko estimated Ukraine\u2019s losses from the war at $103.9 billion and a reduction of its GDP because of the destruction of infrastructure and lost business revenue.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-doubts-kyiv-can-pay-off-its-debts/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-doubts-kyiv-can-pay-off-its-debts/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-doubts-kyiv-can-pay-off-its-debts/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-doubts-kyiv-can-pay-off-its-debts/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-doubts-kyiv-can-pay-off-its-debts/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-doubts-kyiv-can-pay-off-its-debts/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/","title":"fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/#fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism","title":"Fake: European Parliament Finds No Evidence Russia Sponsors Terrorism","text":"<p>2022-08-14, 08:46</p> <p></p> <p>Russian media claims that the European Parliament found no evidence that Russia sponsors terrorism is the opinion of only one parliamentarian \u2013 Gunnar Beck, a member of the pro-Russian Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (Alternative for Germany) party. Beck however did not say anything about the European Parliament and its decisions regarding Russia and terrorism.</p> <p>Claiming that the European Parliament \u201cdid not find evidence of Russian sponsorship of terrorism\u201d is another Russian propagandist fake, consisting of non-existent conclusions, a non-existent European Parliament decision and words attributed to an MEP who was commenting on a related, but nevertheless completely different topic.</p> <p></p> <p>On May 10 in a unanimous vote,\u00a0 Lithuania\u2019s parliament, the Seimas, designated Russia as a terrorist state and its actions in Ukraine as genocide. On August 11 Latvia\u2019s parliament followed suit, declaring Russia a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d for attacks on civilians in its war in Ukraine and urged other countries to do the same. In an attempt to turn the information tide in their favor, Russian propagandists are forging a disinformation campaign with the general message that \u201cthe European Parliament found no evidence that Russia sponsors terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>Stories claiming Russia is not involved in sponsoring terrorism appeared simultaneously in scores of Russian media, particularly on the websites of publications such as Izvestia, Gazeta.ru, RT, Life, RIA Novosti, REN TV, Lenta.ru, Duma.TV, OSN, and others.</p> <p></p> <p>Pro-Kremlin publications such as Tsargrad and Novorossiya went even further and declared that the European Parliament officially did not recognize Russia as a \u201csponsor of terrorism\u201d. The source for this wave of fakes was an interview with Gunnar Beck, a European Parliament member from Germany, who announced that the Lithuanian parliamentary statement was not supported by factual evidence.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cState sponsorship of terrorism involves organized support of politically motivated violence by the government of one state towards another country outside the context of a war between them. I am not aware of any evidence of Russia being involved in any such activities within the EU,\u201d Beck said.</p> <p>Back in March 2022 the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola \u201cstrongly condemned the Russian military aggression against Ukraine and expressed solidarity with all the victims and the dead.\u201d Even after the horrific actions of Russian forces in Bucha, Irpin, Yahidne, Mariupol, Olenivka, Mr. Beck appears to be cluelessly \u201cunaware of evidence that Russia is involved in politically motivated violence.\u201d</p> <p>Gunnar Beck most likely did not notice the Russian atrocities being committed in Ukraine because he is a member of the far right pro-Russian political party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AFD) and believes that the reason for the war in Ukraine may be that \u201cRussia cannot agree with Ukraine\u2019s entry into NATO.\u201d Beck calls Russia sanctions \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d for Europe and futile for Russia itself.</p> <p>However, in the interview cited by Russian media, Gunnar Beck did not mention the European Parliament at all and did not comment on European Parliament decisions regarding Russia and terrorism. Beck\u2019s comments only addressed the Lithuanian parliament\u2019s decision.</p> <p>Nonetheless this did not stop the Russian propaganda machine from using a statement Gunnar Beck never actually uttered and passing it off as the European Parliament\u2019s conclusion, that no evidence was found and therefore, it does not exist. Hence the distorted and manipulative disinformation announcement, \u201cthe European Parliament found no evidence that Russia is a sponsor of terrorism.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-european-parliament-finds-no-evidence-russia-sponsors-terrorism/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-expressing-condolences-zelenskyy-urges-turkey-to-supply-ukraine-more-aid/","title":"fake-expressing-condolences-zelenskyy-urges-turkey-to-supply-ukraine-more-aid","text":"<ul> <li>Factcheck for Facebook_EN</li> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-expressing-condolences-zelenskyy-urges-turkey-to-supply-ukraine-more-aid/#fake-expressing-condolences-zelenskyy-urges-turkey-to-supply-ukraine-more-aid","title":"Fake: Expressing Condolences, Zelenskyy Urges Turkey to Supply Ukraine More Aid","text":"<p>2023-02-09, 17:53</p> <p></p> <p>Russian social media users are claiming that while expressing condolences about the tragic earthquake that struck Turkey, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also reminded Ankara that he hopes Turkey will continue to provide assistance to Ukraine.

Ukrainians themselves do not see any harassment of Russian-speaking Ukrainians, as evidenced by the results of opinion polls.</p> <p>Russian media actively reacted to the anniversary of the adoption of the law \u00abOn Supporting the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language\u00bb in Ukraine by spreading one of the oldest propaganda narratives about the alleged constant oppression of the Russian language.</p> <p>\u00abAnyone who switches to Russian, even if it is their mother tongue, is threatened with punishment and sometimes even death by the authorities,\u00bb one Kremlin outlet said, telling the \u00abtruth\u00bb about what is allegedly happening in Ukraine.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Disinformation about the oppression of the Russian language in Ukraine is a narrative that the Kremlin used to justify the annexation of Crimea and to allegedly \u00abprotect\u00bb the \u00abpeople of Donbas\u00bb. These same narratives are now being used to justify a full-scale war that will supposedly liberate the \u00abRussian people\u00bb.</p> <p>In reality, this \u00abgenocide\u00bb is a complete fantasy of Russian propaganda. The law, which is interpreted by Russians as Russophobic, regulates language policy in the country and makes Ukrainian mandatory in all spheres of public life. At the same time, the legislation does not apply to personal communication or religion, and does not provide for any criminal liability for violations of its norms, \u00ablanguage patrols\u00bb or \u00ablanguage inspectors\u00bb, as propaganda claims.</p> <p>Taras Shamayda, one of the drafters and initiators of the law, describes its main purpose as follows: the document defines in detail how the right to the Ukrainian language is protected in every public sphere, how a citizen can appeal against violations of this right, and what sanctions await violators.</p> <p>In addition, Ukrainians themselves do not feel any harassment against Russian-speaking Ukrainians, as confirmed by various opinion polls. For example, in 2023, 84% of respondents to a survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology agreed with the statement that \u00abthere are no problems with the use of the Russian language in Ukraine and that Russian-speaking citizens are not oppressed and persecuted.\u00bb</p> <p>Commenting on the results of the survey, KIIS Director Anton Grushetsky also noted that compared to 2022, the number of those who believe that there is no harassment has decreased. The number of those who agree that there are no problems with the use of the Russian language in Ukraine has dropped from 93% in 2022 to 84% in 2023.</p> <p>\u00abHowever, such a decrease is quite expected, since since May 2022 the language issue has become the subject of discussions (although in many cases it is more correct to speak not about reasoned discussions, but about speculations on human emotions, where \u2018exaggeration of measure\u2019 often took place). The revitalization of discussions about the use of the \u2018language of the aggressor\u2019 is caused precisely by Russia\u2019s aggression, which does not protect, but contributes to the deterioration of the attitude towards the Russian language,\u00bb explained Grushetsky.</p> <p></p> <p>Earlier, StopFake debunked a number of fakes about the alleged harassment of the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, for example, in the pieces: Manipulation: In Ukraine, People Will Be Fined for Speaking Russian, Fake: Ukraine Makes Speaking Russian Criminal Offence Says Lavrov, Fake: Children in Kherson Region Have Not Learnt Russian Since 2013.</p> <p></p> <p>\u0412\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044e\u043a</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-five-years-ago-russian-language-was-banned-in-ukraine-and-linguistic-genocide-has-began/#related-articlesmore-from-author","title":"RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-five-years-ago-russian-language-was-banned-in-ukraine-and-linguistic-genocide-has-began/#the-pizzagate-of-zelenskis-wife-and-other-cross-border-hoaxes-that-use-women-and-children-to-delegitimize-ukraine","title":"The Pizzagate of Zelenski\u2019s wife, and other cross-border hoaxes that use women and children to delegitimize Ukraine","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-five-years-ago-russian-language-was-banned-in-ukraine-and-linguistic-genocide-has-began/#fake-kitkat-bars-will-be-produced-again-in-russia","title":"Fake: KitKat Bars Will Be Produced Again in Russia","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-five-years-ago-russian-language-was-banned-in-ukraine-and-linguistic-genocide-has-began/#fake-zelenskys-personal-doctor-fled-to-france-bbcbellingcat","title":"Fake: Zelensky\u2019s Personal Doctor Fled to France \u2014 BBC/Bellingcat","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-five-years-ago-russian-language-was-banned-in-ukraine-and-linguistic-genocide-has-began/#stopfake-social-media","title":"StopFake \u2014 social media","text":""},{"location":"articles/fake-five-years-ago-russian-language-was-banned-in-ukraine-and-linguistic-genocide-has-began/#stopfake-in-other-languages","title":"StopFake in other languages","text":"<p>StopFake fact-checking bot</p>"},{"location":"articles/fake-flag-with-nazi-swastika-in-ukraine/","title":"fake-flag-with-nazi-swastika-in-ukraine","text":"<ul> <li>News</li> </ul>"},{"location":"articles/fake-flag-with-nazi-swastika-in-ukraine/#fake-flag-with-nazi-swastika-in-ukraine","title":"Fake: Flag with Nazi Swastika in Ukraine","text":"<p>2014-09-22, 19:15</p> <p></p> <p>On September 20, the official Twitter account of the Permanent Mission of Russia in Geneva published a photo entitled \u201cModern Ukraine.

Neither USA TODAY, which is cited by Russian propaganda, nor any other reputable media outlets have published news with words of gratitude to Ukraine from Mia Khalifa.</p> <p>Kremlin outlets and social media users spread fake news about former American porn star of Lebanese descent Mia Khalifa had allegedly thanked Ukraine for its assistance to the Palestinian Islamic movement Hamas. In such \u201cnews,\u201d users refer to a recorded \u201cconversation\u201d with Khalifa, which was allegedly published by the American publication USA TODAY.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>\u201cPorn star Mia Khalifa thanked Ukraine for helping Hamas. In a telephone conversation, she said: \u201cFrom Ukraine\u2026 There is only one good thing in the world from this corrupt black hole. Without them and their corrupt leadership, Palestine would have spent years gathering weapons for liberation,\u201d users write.</p> <p>The \u201cconversation\u201d itself is presented in a video format and is made in a corporate style similar to the USA TODAY media branding. In the audio, someone in a voice similar to Khalifa\u2019s can be heard \u201cthanking\u201d Ukraine for the weapons. Propaganda distributes two versions of this video. In the first version, only Khalifa\u2019s \u201cspeech\u201d is cut out. The second version also has an accompanying text stating that the actress\u2019 comment was recorded on KCRW radio.</p> <p>After this information was spread, StopFake decided to check whether Mia Khalifa really thanked Ukraine for helping Hamas and told USA TODAY about it. As it turned out, this information is not true.</p> <p>Since neither Russian media nor social media users provided a direct link to the American media, StopFake decided to try to find this \u201cnews\u201d on its own. We checked all of the outlet\u2019s publications related to the military operations in Israel since the Hamas attack. It turned out that neither the website nor the official accounts of this media outlet on Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube published such a conversation with Mia Khalifa. A separate Google search on USA TODAY\u2019s website over the past week also yielded no results.</p> <p>In addition, StopFake tried to find news about Khalifa\u2019s alleged statement in other reputable English-language media, but this also yielded no results. Almost all the news with her name on it is related to her decision to support Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel and Playboy magazine\u2019s decision to terminate her contract. The website of KCRW radio, which is mentioned in the fake video, also has no news about the actress\u2019s alleged statement.</p> <p>We also asked USA TODAY to confirm or deny the publication of the \u201cconversation\u201d with Mia Khalifa, but at the time of publication, we had not yet received a response.</p> <p>This is not the first time propaganda has used the corporate identity of reputable foreign media to publish its fakes.

Quite the opposite, Chalyi has always emphasized that Ukraine\u2019s continue Western integration is clearly enshrined in the Ukrainian Constitution.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s Federal News Agency (riafan) claims that Ukraine\u2019s government can easily achieve peace with Russia by having Ukraine declare itself a neutral country. The agency claims that this idea was put forth by former Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Vitaliy Chalyi, who allegedly said that neutrality is the only formula that can guarantee peace in Ukraine.</p> <p>\u201cNeutrality is a status that is affirmed in Ukraine\u2019s declaration of sovereignty\u201d Riafan points out, seemingly quoting Chalyi.</p> <p></p> <p>Federal News Agency screenshot</p> <p>Ambassador Chalyi however, never said that Ukraine\u2019s government must adhere to neutrality because neutrality figures in the country\u2019s Sovereignty Declaration. He also refutes the propagandist\u2019s claim that Ukraine\u2019s non-aligned status is enshrined in Ukrainian law.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s Declaration of Sovereignty, which was adopted on July 16, 1990 does indeed contain a clause on state neutrality. However, the document was enacted in Soviet times and refers to Ukraine as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, an entity that has not existed for 30 years.</p> <p>The Ukrainian SSR solemnly declares its intention to become a permanently neutral state in the future, not participate in military blocs and adhere to three non-nuclear principles\u201d not to accept, produce or acquire nuclear weapons\u201d the Declaration reads.</p> <p>Writing on his Facebook page, Valeriy Chalyi emphasizes that Russian media references to the Declaration of State Sovereignty as the basis for legitimizing neutrality \u201cdoes not stand up to criticism\u201d. The USSR has long since collapsed and the legal basis for the state sovereignty of modern Ukraine is the Constitution, Chalyi points out, which does not mention any neutrality or nan-aligned status. Quite the contrary, Ukraine\u2019s Constitution enshrines the country\u2019s course for full membership in the European Union and NATO. That is why the narrative of Ukraine\u2019s neutrality is completely inapplicable.</p> <p>Valery Chalyi also repeatedly stresses that Ukraine\u2019s non-aligned position in 2014 led to the Russian occupation of Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. He also noted that neutral countries always have international security guarantees: Ukraine also had such a document \u2013 the Budapest Memorandum \u2013 which Russia brazenly violated by attacking Ukrainian territories in 2014 and on February 24, 2022. \u201cOnly armed resistance to the aggressor and the end of the war with our victory will lead to security and peace.

Mass appearances of bedbugs are not related to anti-Russian sanctions, but to the insects adapting to insecticides, climate change and people beginning to travel more in crowded transport.</p> <p>The Kremlin\u2019s propaganda uses every opportunity to spread disinformation about how allegedly futile and harmful anti-Russian sanctions are. Bedbugs appearing in public places in France was no exception. For example, some social media users and anonymous Telegram channels spread information that the French media La Montagne allegedly blames Russia for the invasion of bugs. In some sources, also citing La Montagne, it is stated that anti-Russian sanctions are to blame for the issue, since France was unable to purchase the necessary means against insects in Russia.</p> <p></p> <p>However, the information spreading online is fake, and the article in La Montagne was completely made up for propaganda purposes.</p> <p>To begin with, the French media La Montagne never published an article entitled \u201cLes sanctions contre la Russie on entraigne une epidemie de punaises de lit a Paris\u201d (\u201cSanctions against Russia led to an epidemic of bedbugs in Paris\u201d). The screenshot circulating online shows that this article allegedly appeared on the publication\u2019s website on October 4. However, StopFake journalists were unable to find it either through a Google search, or by using keywords on the La Montagne website, as well as in the preserved version of the website in the Internet Archive. A screenshot of this post was most likely created in a photo editor.</p> <p>French media have repeatedly written about how Russia uses the subject of bedbugs to spread disinformation about Ukrainians in France. For example, France 24 \u00a0and Liberation previously wrote that Russian anonymous Telegram channels falsely blame the arrival of Ukrainian refugees for the bedbugs influx.</p> <p>French Health Minister Aurelien Rousseau urged not to panic over bedbugs spotted on public transport in Paris.
